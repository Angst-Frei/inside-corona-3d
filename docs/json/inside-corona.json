The goals include a broad array of targets across different sectors. The target to achieve UHC is a beacon of hope for a healthier world.<br/>The inclusion of UHC in the SDGs presents an opportunity to promote a comprehensive and coherent approach to health, focusing on health systems strengthening (HSS). UHC is based on the principle that all individuals and communities should have access to quality essential health services without suffering financial hardship.

Comprised of political leaders, agency principals and world-class experts, the Board provides an independent and comprehensive appraisal for policy makers and the world about progress towards increased preparedness and response capacity for disease outbreaks and other emergencies with health consequences. In short, the work of the GPMB will be to chart a roadmap for a safer world.<br/>Created in response to recommendations by the UN Secretary General&#8217;s Global Health Crises Task Force in 2017, the GPMB was co-convened by the World Health Organization and the World Bank Group and formally launched in May 2018. The GPMB is led by its co-chairs, Elhadj As Sy, Chair of the Kofi Annan Foundation Board, former Secretary General of the IFRC, and Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Prime Minister of Norway and former WHO Director-General.<br/>Why was the GPMB created?<br/>There are severe health and economic costs of failing to adequately prepare for and manage disease outbreaks and other health emergencies for countries and communities globally. Recent health emergencies, including the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, shed light on the major gaps in sustained political will, action, and sustainable financing for preparedness; national public health systems&#8217; capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to health crises from the local to global levels; community trust deficits in local health systems; along with a need to accelerate research and development, and to enhance global and regional coordination and capabilities.

Research is divided across four areas: disease dynamics and behavior, disease dynamics and information structure, delivery of new technologies for disease control, and innovative financing.&#91;1&#93;<br/>Two key CDDEP initiatives focus on antibiotic resistance as a public health crisis. Within the United States, the Extending the Cure (ETC) project has received widespread media attention for work examining the costs of hospital acquired infections (HAIs)&#91;2&#93; and designing novel incentive-based strategies to encourage antibiotic conservation.&#91;3&#93; ETC researchers have contributed to Roll Call,&#91;4&#93; the Wall Street Journal,&#91;5&#93; and the Baltimore Sun,&#91;6&#93; among others. In addition, The Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership is developing actionable policy proposals on antibiotic resistance for five low- and middle-income countries: China, India, Kenya, South Africa, and Vietnam.&#91;7&#93;<br/>CDDEP staff are also well known in the field of malaria research. Senior fellows were pioneers of the global subsidy idea that became Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm),&#91;8&#93; an innovative financing mechanism designed to expand access to the most effective treatment for malaria through the public, private and NGO sectors.&#91;9&#93; CDDEP has contributed to malaria elimination planning in Zanzibar, and to efforts to promote the use of multiple first-line therapies (MFTs) to slow resistance to antimalarial drugs.&#91;10&#93;<br/>Current projects<br/>Extending the Cure<br/>The Extending the Cure (ETC) project is a research and consultative effort that frames the growing problem of antibiotic resistance as a challenge in managing a shared societal resource. The ETC inaugural report and its subsequent papers examine the range of issues around resistance and look at innovative policy solutions to encourage the conservation of antibiotics without stifling new drug development.&#91;11&#93;<br/>Extending the Cure is funded in part by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation through its Pioneer Portfolio, which supports innovative projects that may lead to breakthrough improvements in health and health care.&#91;12&#93;<br/>Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership<br/>The Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership (GARP) was started in 2009 to create a platform for developing actionable policy proposals on antibiotic resistance in low-income and middle-income countries.<br/>During the first three years, Phase 1 of GARP established national working groups in four countries: India, Kenya, South Africa and Vietnam. Those working groups&#8212;multidisciplinary, with representatives from all sectors, dealing with both human and animal antibiotic use&#8212;have become national resources for their expertise and linkages to the current global activities in antibiotic resistance. GARP Phase 1 culminated in the 1st Global Forum on Bacterial Infections: Balancing Treatment Access and Antibiotic Resistance on October 3&#8211;5, 2011, in New Delhi, India. Since GARP Phase 2 began in 2012, national working groups have been established in Mozambique, Nepal, Tanzania and Uganda.<br/>The GARP secretariat at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy (CDDEP), in Washington, DC and New Delhi, provides technical support to each working group, creates links within the GARP network and involves the working groups in global discussions and policy development. GARP is a CDDEP project, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.<br/>Affordable Medicines Facility--Malaria<br/>The Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm) is an innovative financing mechanism designed to expand access to the most effective treatment for malaria, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) through the public, private and NGO sectors. It will reduce the use of drugs that no longer work because of drug resistance, and reduce the use of artemisinin by itself, as monotherapy, thereby delaying the onset of resistance to that drug and preserving its effectiveness. AMFm is being managed by the Global Fund with directed financing from UNITAID, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), and other donors.<br/>CDDEP researchers have been involved with the global subsidy idea behind AMFm since 2002, when the U.S. Institute of Medicine committee first deliberated on the questions of how to expand access to ACTs while maintaining the effectiveness of artemisinin compounds.&#91;13&#93;<br/>Disease Control Priorities Project<br/>Further information: Disease Control Priorities Project<br/>A joint effort of The World Bank, the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health, and the World Health Organization, with substantial technical input from CDDEP researchers, DCPP was launched in 2001 as a four-year initiative to improve the health of people in developing countries by identifying disease control priorities based on scientific evidence and cost-effectiveness. Researchers at CDDEP were involved in carrying out the economic analysis for a number of chapters as well as in writing the cross-cutting chapter summarizing the main economic messages of the project, as well as the Lancet paper summarizing the main messages of the project. CDDEP researchers also co-led DCPP in India. That effort resulted in a book, &#8220;Choosing Health: An Entitlement for All Indians.&#8221;&#91;14&#93; The overarching paradigm for DCPP is of quantitative evaluation of health system interventions and prioritizing interventions on the basis of cost-effectiveness.&#91;15&#93;<br/>Malaria Atlas Project--Elimination<br/>A complement to the Malaria Atlas Project, this research seeks to develop an improved bio-economic model for trans-boundary malaria control financing that considers imported malaria. Research couples economic models to the stochastic spatial models largely based on malaria transmission intensity data assembled by the Malaria Atlas Project. Research includes modeling vectors and malaria transmission to develop the further spatial components. The end product of this effort will be the development of a tool for making estimates of malaria transmission intensity and burden as a function of financing strategies.&#91;16&#93;<br/>Golden Mustard<br/>CDDEP&#8217;s Golden Mustard project, funded by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Colombia, examines the potential impact of biofortification of mustard in India. The Indian context presents specific challenges: widely dispersed food production systems and sporadic health center access have hampered interventions to distribute vitamin A supplements, industrially fortified foods, or biofortified seed products in the past. CDDEP&#8217;s Golden Mustard project looks at how mustard biofortification could be an advantageous addition to a portfolio of strategies to alleviate Vitamin A deficiency in this context.&#91;15&#93;<br/>Multiple First-line Therapies<br/>If two drugs (in combination) are good, are three or more being used concurrently by different patients better at keeping drug resistance at bay? The question has practical consequences, as nearly every malaria-endemic country adopts a single first-line treatment (now, a combination drug) as policy. National policies are difficult to change and to implement in these relatively poor countries, and good evidence would be needed to adopt a more complex approach. CDDEP researchers began investigating MFT in 2006 using an evolutionary-epidemiological modeling framework. They compared MFT with single combination drugs and with cycling strategies where therapies are rotated, either on a fixed cycling schedule or when resistance levels or treatment failure become too high. Compared with these alternatives, the analysis predicts that MFT strategies will delay the emergence and slow the fixation of resistant strains.&#91;15&#93;<br/>Notable Work<br/>The Center for Global Development describes CDDEP as a complement to \"the CDC, WHO, and other agencies who fulfill basic surveillance and public health roles, but can&#8217;t give us much (if any) insight into the economic consequences of pandemic flu and other health disasters, nor can they use this insight to promote needed policy reform in the U.S. and globally.\"&#91;17&#93;<br/>Extending the Cure&#8217;s inaugural report Extending the Cure: Policy Responses to the Growing Threat of Antibiotic Resistance, has been widely debated at a series of consultations with representatives from the medical, insurance, pharmaceutical, government, and academic communities. It set the stage for continued research in the form of technical papers and policy briefs to prevent the impending health crisis of widespread antibiotic resistance.&#91;18&#93;<br/>ETC received national media attention for its study on the costs of Hospital-Acquired Infections, including coverage by NPR, ABC, CNN, and Reuters.&#91;19&#93; Published in Archives of Internal Medicine, the study demonstrated that two conditions caused by HAIs killed 48,000 people and ramped up health care costs by $8.1 billion in 2006 alone.&#91;20&#93;<br/>The 2010 ETC-sponsored paper Fighting Antibiotic Resistance: Marrying New Financial Incentives to Meeting Public Health Goalswas cited by the Guardian as &#8220;a radical plan to save antibiotics.&#8221; The study, published in Health Affairs, examined novel strategies for conserving antibiotics while also encouraging new drug development.&#91;21&#93;<br/>ETC research featured in the CDC's Emerging Infectious Diseases also received widespread national media coverage.&#91;22&#93; The study found the community-associated strain of the deadly superbug MRSA&#8212;an infection-causing bacteria resistant to most common antibiotics&#8212;poses a far greater health threat than previously known and is making its way into hospitals. The new threat is easily picked up in fitness centers, schools, and other public places and has increased the overall burden of MRSA within hospitals. The study analyzed data from more than 300 microbiology labs serving hospitals all over the United States, found a seven-fold increase in the proportion of \"community-associated\" strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, in outpatient hospital units between 1999 and 2006.&#91;23&#93;<br/>Former CDDEP Senior Fellow David L. Smith&#8217;s 2010 study in Nature, \"Climate Change and the Global Malaria Recession\", rebuked the widespread claim that climate change will be linked to increasing malaria incidence.&#91;24&#93;<br/>CDDEP researchers are contributing to the Lancet Series on Malaria Elimination as well as to the 5th report in Roll Back Malaria&#8217;s Progress & Impact Series.&#91;25&#93;<br/>CDDEP is known as a pioneer in researching Multiple First-line Therapies as a means of slowing the spread of drug resistance to antimalarials.&#91;10&#93;<br/>Key Researchers<br/>Ramanan Laxminarayan is director and senior fellow at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy. He is also a visiting scholar and lecturer at Princeton University. His research deals with the integration of epidemiological models of infectious diseases and drug resistance into the economic analysis of public health problems. He has worked to improve understanding of drug resistance as a problem of managing a shared global resource. Laxminarayan has worked with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank on evaluating malaria treatment policy, vaccination strategies, the economic burden of tuberculosis, and control of non-communicable diseases. He has served on a number of advisory committees at WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the &#91;Institute of Medicine&#93;. In 2003-04, he served on the National Academy of Science/Institute of Medicine Committee on the Economics of Antimalarial Drugs and subsequently helped create the Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm), a novel financing mechanism for antimalarials. Laxminarayan received his undergraduate degree in engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science in Pilani, India, and his master's degree in public health (Epidemiology) and doctorate in economics from the University of Washington in Seattle.&#91;15&#93;<br/>Hellen Gelband focuses on health policy issues in the United States and internationally. During her career, she has used the evaluation of medical evidence to inform a wide range of both American and global health policies. Her work at CDDEP explores the growing resistance to antibiotic and anti-malarial drugs, as well as access to and cost of such pharmaceuticals. She is the coordinator of the Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership (GARP) &#8211; a project that has established centers in five developing countries to foster rational policies governing the use of antibiotics. Gelband spent 15 years at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment and ten years at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. She has also worked for the World Health Organization, the University of Oxford, Doctors without Borders, and a number of foreign governments and U.S.-based consulting companies.&#91;15&#93;<br/>Arindam Nandi is an economist who focuses on the health and development economics and in particular the long-term effects of health, nutrition, and physical activity in early childhood on cognitive, educational, and labor market outcomes in developing country settings. He has also evaluated the sex-selective abortion frequency in both the US and India and the sex-ration effects and potentially unintended effects of this procedure at the population level. In addition to being a fellow at CDDEP, Dr. Nandi is also a visiting scholar the Public Health Foundation of India, and he has worked with the World Bank and with the newly founded University of California Global Health Institute. He graduated with a PhD in Economics from the University of California, Riverside in 2010.&#91;26&#93;<br/>Eili Y. Klein is a fellow at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy and an assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Johns Hopkins University. He has a PhD in ecology and evolutionary biology from Princeton University.

Over the following two years, the Commission worked to identify the key weaknesses and gaps in U.S. global health security policy, with a special focus on strengthening U.S. engagement outside our borders while also addressing domestic preparedness.<br/>In November 2019, the Commission released a major report, Ending the Cycle of Crisis and Complacency in U.S. Global Health Security. In the report, the Commission calls for the reestablishment of health security capacity at the White House; several new long-term and fast-acting funding mechanisms to build capacities in vulnerable low- and middle-income countries; new executive operational capacities to respond to health security threats in disordered settings; and accelerated efforts to develop new technologies and battle misinformation more systematically. The Commission continues to advance these strategic actions and track progress in their adoption and implementation.<br/>The Covid-19 pandemic subsequently exposed additional vulnerabilities both at home and abroad, triggering massive health, economic, and social crises. Building on its record of achievement, its strong reputation and credibility, and its exceptional membership, over the next two years the Commission will drive discourse and develop concrete action agendas for U.S. health security policy in the Covid-19 era. The Commission has begun this work, which will continue through October 2022.<br/>The Commission will focus on the following key issues as it seeks to generate a concrete vision for U.S. global health security that addresses evolving geopolitical challenges and the acute vulnerabilities exploited by the coronavirus.<br/>U.S. Leadership in the Covid-19 Era<br/>U.S. leadership is essential in shaping and supporting diplomatic and multilateral efforts in response to health security emergencies. That is true for the Covid-19 response and recovery efforts, including Covid-19 vaccine distribution and the economic recovery. Yet U.S. government capacities have withered as the United States receded from the world stage both before and during the pandemic.<br/>The Commission will map out how U.S. leadership is to be restored after a period of significant regression, with what priorities and through what concrete steps, both during and after the pandemic. This will involve an assessment of key U.S. institutions and their role in global health security, particularly the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and White House capacities. The Commission will reexamine the unique capacities that the military can bring to global health security issues and how that role might evolve in the Covid-19 era. The Commission will also pursue reform to enhance the resilience and independence of U.S. public health institutions, particularly the CDC.<br/>Sustaining immunizations and community health programs and ensuring public trust and confidence in vaccines will be critical to global security in the Covid-19 era. In rethinking U.S. leadership, the Commission will focus on promoting health security through immunizations and the growing recognition of the essential role played by the primary health care system in disease prevention and outbreak response.<br/>Building a New Order<br/>Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a political paralysis in such key institutions as the UN Security Council, G-7, and G-20 and a conspicuous dearth of high-level diplomacy on global health security issues. U.S. diplomatic leadership has been largely absent as this void has widened. The Commission will weigh in on the many efforts to reform the current global health, development, and health security institutions and partnerships, including the World Health Organization and the Global Health Security Agenda, and it will advance a renewed U.S. health security diplomatic strategy for the Covid-19 era.<br/>The Commission will recommend steps that the United States should take to rebuild a more effective and responsive international order, both politically and operationally. This will include recommendations for how the United States can revitalize its relationship with the European Union and other key partners and allies in an effort to achieve a united reform effort.<br/>The Commission will also examine the toxic U.S.-China strategic competition and options for achieving a more effective and pragmatic interaction with China on health security issues. The Commission will examine options to secure markets and supply chains and address overreliance on foreign manufacturing (particularly Chinese manufacturing) for critical medical supplies and equipment.<br/>Science and Anti-Science<br/>We live in a paradoxical moment of both scientific renaissance and burgeoning assaults upon the legitimacy and credibility of science. We are in the midst of an accelerating revolution in the life sciences, an Age of Biology. The bioeconomy has moved front and center in U.S. national security priorities and policies. This momentous shift will create new opportunities for gains in public and global health, along with challenges of equity and access and increased risks in biosecurity and biosafety.<br/>At the same time, the rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation has weakened public trust and confidence in science and public health institutions. The misuse and weaponization of social media has helped to fuel a resurgence of vaccine preventable disease and will significantly impede the introduction of Covid-19 vaccines, both domestically and globally.<br/>The Commission will strive to illuminate these trends, assess their implications for global health security, and identify what new U.S. policies, capacities, and programs are required.<br/>MEET THE COMMISSION<br/>Commission Members and Contributors<br/>SKIP TO...<br/>Commission Members<br/>Experts and Advisors<br/>Secretariat<br/>Health Commission is a product of the Andreas C.

Plotkin (co-discoverer of the Rubella vaccine), and American expert in infectious diseases Adel Mahmoud (developer of the HPV vaccine and rotavirus vaccine).&#91;6&#93;&#91;11&#93;<br/>Their concept was further expanded at the 2016 WEF in Davos, where it was discussed as a solution to the problems encountered in developing and distributing a vaccine for the Western African Ebola virus epidemic.&#91;2&#93; Co-founder and funder, Bill Gates said: \"The market is not going to solve this problem because epidemics do not come along very often &#8212; and when they do you are not allowed to charge some huge premium price for the tools involved\".&#91;2&#93; CEPI's creation was also supported and co-funded by the pharmaceutical industry including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), with CEO Sir Andrew Witty explaining at the WEF, \"It is super-disruptive when the red phone rings in our vaccine division because of a health emergency. People do not realise that there's no spare capacity in the world's vaccine production system today\".&#91;2&#93;<br/>CEPI was formally launched at the 2017 WEF in Davos, with an initial investment of US$460 million by a consortium that included the governments of Norway, Japan, and Germany, The Wellcome Trust, and the Gates Foundation;&#91;12&#93;&#91;2&#93; India joined a short time afterwards.&#91;13&#93;&#91;14&#93; In a launch interview with the Financial Times (FT), Gates said that a key goal was to reduce the time to develop vaccines from 10 years to less than 12 months.&#91;2&#93;<br/>The initial targets were the six EID viruses with known potential to cause major epidemics, being: MERS, Lassa fever, Nipah virus, Ebola, Marburg fever and Zika.&#91;2&#93;&#91;4&#93; The FT reported CEPI would \"build the scientific and technological infrastructure for developing vaccines quickly against pathogens that emerge from nowhere to cause a global health crisis, such as Sars in 2002/03 and Zika in 2015/16\", and fund research papers on the costs and process of vaccine development.&#91;2&#93; Town & Country listed it as one of the top-10 newsworthy moments from the 2017 Davos.&#91;15&#93; At launch, Norwegian physician John-Arne R&#248;ttingen, who led the steering committee for Ebola vaccine trials, served as interim CEO, and CEPI was based at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in Oslo.&#91;6&#93;<br/>In April 2017, Richard J. Hatchett, former director of the U.S. government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), became the full-time CEO.&#91;16&#93; Hatchett was also a member of the United States Homeland Security Council under George W. Bush, and the United States National Security Council, under Barack Obama.&#91;10&#93;&#91;17&#93; Also in April 2017, CEPI opened an additional office in London, and in October 2017, a further office was opened in Washington, D.C.&#91;18&#93;<br/>Funding<br/>At its launch in 2017, CEPI announced five-year financial pledges from its founders that amounted to US$460 million and came from the sovereign governments of Japan (US$125 million), Norway (US$120 million), and Germany (US$10.6 million in 2017 alone, and which later became US$90 million), and from global foundations of the Gates Foundation (US$100 million), and the Wellcome Trust (US$100 million); India was finalising their financial commitment, which was made shortly afterward.&#91;19&#93; A funding target of US$1 billion was set for the first 5 years of operation (i.e. by January 2022).&#91;19&#93; The journal Nature said of the amount raised that: \"It is by far the largest vaccine development initiative ever against viruses that are potential epidemic threats\".&#91;8&#93;<br/>As part of its funding structure, CEPI has used \"vaccine bonds\" to \"frontload\" multi-year sovereign funding pledges. In 2019, the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm) issued NOK 600 million in vaccine bonds to front-load the commitment by Norway, through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to CEPI.&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93;<br/>In March 2019, the European Commission granted access to CEPI into the EU's Horizon 2020 programme, and a longer-term financial funding programme.&#91;22&#93; CEPI note presentations that the EU's financial commitment amounts to US$200 million, which when added to the seed amount (including the full German commitment), came to US$740 million.&#91;23&#93;<br/>By February 2020, Bloomberg News reported that CEPI had raised a total of US$760 million with additional donations from the governments of Australia, Belgium, Canada, and the U.K.&#91;3&#93; Bloomberg said that \"CEPI solves what economists call a 'coordination problem'. It can help pair boutique research and development companies with big vaccine manufacturers, work with regulators to streamline approval processes and resolve patent disputes on the spot. Its scientific advisory committee has executives from Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical, among others\".&#91;3&#93;<br/>In March 2020, the British government pledged &#163;210 million in funding to CEPI to specifically focus on a vaccine for the coronavirus; making Britain CEPI's largest individual donor.&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93;<br/>"},{"id":37,"title":"Apolitical","group":"Organization","image":"img/Apolitical.png","value":1,"notes":"<br/><a href=\"https://apolitical.co/home\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://apolitical.co/home</a><br/>"},{"id":38,"title":"PharmAccess Foundation","group":"Organization","image":"img/PharmAccess_Foundation.png","value":1,"notes":"e believe that technology has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare sector.

The Chair and Deputy Chair of the Board of Supervisory Directors are the German Federal Ministers of Finance and of Economic Affairs, with the positions alternating annually between them. The chairman as of March 2018 is Peter Altmaier, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy.&#91;6&#93;<br/>In 2009, Caisse des D&#233;pots, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, KfW and European Investment Bank founded the Long-Term Investors Club.&#91;7&#93;<br/>Operations<br/>KfW banking group covers over 90% of its borrowing needs in the capital markets, mainly through bonds that are guaranteed by the federal government. This allows KfW to raise funds at advantageous conditions. Its exemption from having to pay corporate taxes due to its legal status as a public agency and unremunerated equity provided by its public shareholders allow KfW to provide loans for purposes prescribed by the KfW law at lower rates than commercial banks. KfW is not allowed to compete with commercial banks, but it facilitates their business in areas within its mandate. KfW banking group has three business units with distinct functions, as well as several subsidiaries.<br/>Lending by KfW group&#8217;s two main business units, accounting for more than 90% of total lending, is in Germany and, to a limited extent, in other European countries. However, its largest subsidiary, KfW IPEX-Bank GmbH, predominantly lends internationally. A smaller subsidiary, the German Investment Corporation (DEG), and one of the group&#8217;s smaller business units, KfW Development Bank, are exclusively active in the international arena, each within their particular business areas.<br/>Subsidiaries and group units<br/>Housing and environment<br/>KfW F&#246;rderbank (KfW promotional Bank), the largest business unit of the group, committed &#8364;47.6 billion in 2014, mostly for housing and environmental protection in Germany.&#91;8&#93; It is especially active in promoting energy-efficient housing for owner-occupied houses as well as for landlords, both for new houses and refurbishments.&#91;9&#93; Its energy efficiency standards for houses (KfW-60 and KfW-40) have become accepted standards in Germany. Concerning environmental protection, it promotes, among others, photovoltaic energy (solar cells) which has in turn received massive indirect subsidies through feed-in tariffs&#91;10&#93; under the Renewable Energy Law of 2000. It also invests in municipal infrastructure such as public transport and sanitation through a sub-unit called KfW Kommunalbank (KfW municipal bank). More recently (since 2006), it has also engaged in education where it provides student loans.<br/>Small and medium enterprises<br/>KfW Mittelstandsbank (which roughly translates as KfW small and medium enterprises bank), the second largest business unit of the group, provides assistance to German small and medium enterprises (SMEs) including individual entrepreneurs and start-ups. In addition to loans it also provides equity and mezzanine financing. Its financing totaled &#8364;20.4 billion in 2015. &#91;11&#93;<br/>KfW has been very active in securitization before this market collapsed during the subprime mortgage crisis. Through securitization it helped commercial banks to transfer risks from their housing and SME portfolios to the capital market. KfW also provides loans to European commercial banks to help them finance SMEs, housing and infrastructure (so-called global loans).<br/>Development aid<br/>KfW Entwicklungsbank (KfW Development Bank) provides financing to governments, public enterprises and commercial banks engaged in microfinance and SME promotion in developing countries. It does so through loans close to market terms using its own resources (\"promotional loans\"), soft loans that blend KfW resources with support from the federal government's aid budget (\"development loans\"), as well as highly subsidized loans and grants, the latter two coming entirely from the federal aid budget. Different country groups are offered different financing conditions depending mainly on their per capita income. All these financing instruments are part of what is officially called development cooperation and is more commonly called \"development aid\".<br/>In German aid, the work of KfW Development Bank is called \"financial cooperation\" which is complemented by \"technical cooperation\" by GIZ and other public agencies. The main sectors of financial cooperation are water supply and sanitation, renewable energy and energy efficiency, as well as the development of the financial sector. KfW Development Bank also works, among other sectors, in health, education, agriculture, forestry, solid waste management. It provided &#8364;7.4 billion in loans and grants in 2014.&#91;8&#93;<br/>Export and project finance<br/>The largest subsidiary of KfW banking group is KfW IPEX-Bank. KfW IPEX-Bank is active in project finance and corporate finance related to German or European exports. It also promotes foreign investments in Germany. Unlike KfW, it competes directly with commercial banks. Therefore, and in response to concerns voiced by the European Commission concerning unfair competition, KfW IPEX-Bank has become legally and financially independent in 2008. KfW IPEX-Bank's main sectors of activity are ports, airports, toll roads, bridges and tunnels, railways, ships, planes, telecommunications, energy, and manufacturing. In 2014 the balance sheet total of KfW IPEX-Bank amounted to &#8364;26.3 billion.&#91;8&#93;<br/>Another subsidiary of KfW banking group, the German Investment Corporation (DEG), takes minority equity stakes and provides loans to private companies investing in developing countries. It pursues a business model broadly similar to that of the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group. Its main sectors of activity are banking, agro-business, renewable energy, telecommunications and manufacturing. It lent 1.2 billion&#91;clarification needed&#93; in 2008.&#91;8&#93;<br/>State shareholding<br/>On behalf of the German state, KfW holds shares in a variety of corporations, including Deutsche Post, Deutsche Telekom,&#91;12&#93; Commerzbank, Lufthansa,&#91;13&#93; and CureVac.&#91;14&#93;<br/>Advisory services<br/>In 2013, KfW agreed to help establish a Portuguese financial institution to foster economic growth and boost job creation in the country.&#91;15&#93;<br/>Awards<br/>The magazine Global Finance rated KfW as the safest bank in the world in its \"World's 50 Safest Banks 2014\" rating. The rating was based on long-term foreign currency ratings from Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor's and the long-term bank deposit ratings from Moody's Investors Service.&#91;16&#93;<br/>Controversy<br/>In September 2008, as investors were scrambling to get their funds out of Lehman Brothers, KfW accidentally wired 426 million&#91;clarification needed&#93; to Lehman; Germany's largest circulation newspaper, Bild, subsequently called KfW \"Germany's Dumbest Bank\" at the time.&#91;17&#93; The bank subsequently fired two board members over the transfer.<br/>Due to a glitch in the bank&#8217;s information technology, KfW again accidentally transferred 7.6 billion euros ($8.2 billion) to four other banks in February 2017 but got the money back, incurring costs of 25,000 euros.&#91;18&#93;<br/>See also<br/>"},{"id":42,"title":"C-CAMP - Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms","group":"Organization","image":"img/C-CAMP_-_Centre_for_Cellular_and_Molecular_Platforms.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://carb-x.org/partners/global-accelerator-network/\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://carb-x.org/partners/global-accelerator-network/</a><br/>Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms (C-CAMP): C-CAMP is India&#8217;s premier Life Science innovation, entrepreneurship and technology hub as well as one of the largest life science incubators in the country.

Founded in 1982, the Whitehead became a major center for genomics and the Human Genome Project. As early as 1995, scientists at the Whitehead started pilot projects in genomic medicine, forming an unofficial collaborative network among young scientists interested in genomic approaches to cancer and human genetics. Another cornerstone was the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology established by Harvard Medical School in 1998 to pursue chemical genetics as an academic discipline.&#91;4&#93; Its screening facility was one of the first high-throughput resources opened in an academic setting. It facilitated small molecule screening projects for more than 80 research groups worldwide.<br/>To create a new organization that was open, collaborative, cross-disciplinary and able to organize projects at any scale, planning took place in 2002&#8211;2003 among philanthropists Eli and Edythe Broad, MIT, the Whitehead Institute, Harvard and the Harvard-affiliated hospitals (in particular, the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Massachusetts General Hospital).<br/>The Broads made a founding gift of $100 million and the Broad Institute was formally launched in May 2004. In November 2005, the Broads announced an additional $100 million gift to the institute.&#91;5&#93; On September 4, 2008, the Broads announced an endowment of $400 million to make the Broad Institute a permanent establishment.&#91;6&#93; In November 2013, they invested an additional $100 million to fund a second decade of research at the institute.&#91;7&#93;<br/>During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the Broad Institute ran laboratory tests for the virus for about 100 colleges and universities in the northeastern U.S.&#91;8&#93;<br/>Organizational structure<br/>The Broad Institute has 11 core faculty&#91;9&#93; and 195 associate members from Harvard, MIT, and the Harvard-affiliated hospitals.&#91;10&#93;<br/>The Broad Institute is made up of three types of organizational units: core member laboratories, research programs, and platforms. The institute's scientific research programs include:&#91;11&#93;<br/>Cancer Program<br/>Program in Medical and Population Genetics<br/>Genome Biology and Cell Circuits Program<br/>Chemical Biology Program<br/>Metabolism Program<br/>Infectious Disease Program<br/>Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at Broad Institute<br/>Genome Sequencing and Analysis Program<br/>Epigenomics Program<br/>Vertebrate Genomics Program<br/>The Broad Institute's platforms are teams of professional scientists who focus on the discovery, development, and optimization of the technological tools that Broad and other researchers use to conduct research. The platforms include:&#91;12&#93;<br/>Data Sciences Platform<br/>Genomics Platform<br/>Imaging Platform<br/>Metabolite Profiling Platform<br/>Proteomics Platform<br/>Genetic Perturbation Platform<br/>Therapeutics Platform<br/>Therapeutics Projects Group<br/>The Broad Institute also supports the Data Visualization Initiative led by the Institute creative director Bang Wong, which is aimed at developing data visualizations to explore and communicate research findings.&#91;13&#93;<br/>Core members<br/>The faculty and staff of the Broad Institute include physicians, geneticists, and molecular, chemical, and computational biologists. The faculty currently includes 11 Core Members, whose labs are primarily located within the Broad Institute, and 195 Associate Members, whose primary labs are located at one of the universities or hospitals.&#91;14&#93;<br/>The Core Members of the Broad Institute include:&#91;15&#93;<br/>Paul Blainey is an expert in microfluidic systems to study single molecules and cells; one of the main aims of his lab is to make single-cell analysis routine.<br/>Todd Golub, a physician-researcher, is director of the cancer program. He applies genomic tools to the classification and study of cancers.<br/>Myriam Heiman combines genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology to study the features that define different types of neurons and their vulnerability to disease.<br/>Deborah Hung is a chemical biologist and an infectious disease physician who studies the interactions between pathogens and their hosts, with the goal of discovering new antibiotic targets.<br/>Steven Hyman is the director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research.&#91;16&#93;<br/>Eric Lander is the director of the Broad Institute. A geneticist, molecular biologist and mathematician, Lander has been a driving force in the development of genomics and a prominent leader of the Human Genome Project.<br/>David R. Liu is a chemist and a chemical biologist, the Director of the Merkin Institute, the inventor of DNA-templated synthesis, phage-assisted directed evolution and Cas9/CRISPR base-editing.<br/>Aviv Regev is a computational biologist with interests in biological networks, gene regulation and evolution.<br/>Stuart Schreiber is director of the Chemical Biology program.

As WICGR (Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research), this facility was the largest contributor of sequence information to the Human Genome Project.<br/>In February 2006, The Broad Institute expanded to a new building at 415 Main Street, adjacent to the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research.&#91;17&#93; This seven-story 231,000-square-foot (21,500 m2) building contains office, research laboratory, retail and museum space. In 2011, the institute announced plans to construct an additional tower adjacent to the 415 Main Street site at 75 Ames Street.&#91;18&#93; On May 21, 2014, the Broad officially inaugurated a 375,000-square-foot research building at 75 Ames Street in Cambridge's Kendall Square.&#91;19&#93; The new facility has 15 floors, 11 of which are occupied, and has LEED gold certification. As of July 2014, it has around 800 occupants.<br/>Funding<br/>Between 2009 and 2012, the operating revenue of the institute was approximately $200 million, with 55% of that coming from federal grants.&#91;20&#93; The Broad Foundation (Eli and Edythe Broad) has provided $700 million in funding to the Broad Institute as of February 2014.&#91;21&#93;<br/>The Klarman Family Foundation provided a $32.5 million grant to Broad to study cellular processes in 2012.&#91;22&#93; In October 2013, Fundaci&#243;n Carlos Slim (the Carlos Slim Foundation) of Mexico announced a $74 million grant to Broad Institute for the SIGMA2 consortium.&#91;23&#93;<br/>In July 2014, coinciding with the publication of a new study on the genetics of schizophrenia,&#91;24&#93; the Broad Institute received a $650 million gift from the Stanley Family Foundation, one of the largest private gifts ever for scientific research.&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93;<br/>On October 10, 2017, it was reported that Deerfield Management Co. was giving $50 million to the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard to support biology research.&#91;28&#93;<br/>Honors<br/>Since 2010, the Broad Institute has been listed on The Boston Globe's Top Places to Work. The 2014 report from Thomson Reuters' ScienceWatch entitled \"The World's Most Influential Scientific Minds\" recognized that 12 out of the 17 \"hottest\" researchers in science belonged to genomics, and 4 out of the top 5 were affiliated with the Broad Institute.&#91;29&#93; Additionally, Stacey B. Gabriel of the Broad Institute topped this entire list. Twenty-eight researchers from Broad Institute have been recognized on ISI's Highly Cited, a database that recognizes the top 250 researchers in multiple areas of science.&#91;30&#93;<br/>Eric S. Lander, Stuart L. Schreiber, Aviv Regev and Edward M. Scolnick are members of the National Academy of Sciences&#91;31&#93; and the Institute of Medicine. David Altshuler is a member of the Institute of Medicine.&#91;32&#93; Feng Zhang received the 2014 Alan T. Waterman Award from the National Science Foundation, its highest honor that annually recognizes an outstanding researcher under the age of 35, for contributions to both optogenetics and CRISPR technology.&#91;33&#93;<br/>In biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology areas, the institute was ranked #1 in the \"Mapping Excellence\" report, a survey that assessed high-impact publications.&#91;34&#93;<br/>For its architecture, Broad's 415 Main Street building architects Elkus Manfredi Architects of Boston and AHSC McLellan Copenhagen of San Francisco received high honors in the 2007 Laboratory of the Year competition of the R&D Magazine.&#91;35&#93;<br/><a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants?q=The%20Broad%20Institute\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants?q=The%20Broad%20Institute</a><br/>"},{"id":57,"title":"Richard D.

Brookings (1850&#8211;1932)<br/>Brookings was founded in 1916 as the Institute for Government Research (IGR), with the mission of becoming \"the first private organization devoted to analyzing public policy issues at the national level.\"&#91;20&#93;<br/>The Institution's founder, a philanthropist Robert S. Brookings (1850&#8211;1932), originally created the formation of three organizations: the Institute for Government Research, the Institute of Economics (with funds from the Carnegie Corporation), and the Robert Brookings Graduate School affiliated with Washington University in St. Louis. The three were merged into the Brookings Institution on December 8, 1927.&#91;5&#93;&#91;21&#93;<br/>During the Great Depression, economists at Brookings embarked on a large-scale study commissioned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to understand the underlying causes of the depression. Brookings's first president Harold Moulton and other Brookings scholars later led an effort to oppose President Roosevelt's National Recovery Administration because they thought the NRA was impeding economic recovery.&#91;22&#93;<br/>With the entry into World War II in 1941, Brookings researchers turned their attention to aiding the administration with a series of studies on mobilization. In 1948, Brookings was asked to submit a plan for the administration of the European Recovery Program. The resulting organization scheme assured that the Marshall Plan was run carefully and on a businesslike basis.&#91;23&#93;<br/>In 1952, Robert Calkins succeeded Moulton as president of the Brookings Institution. He secured grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation that put the Institution on a strong financial basis. He reorganized the Institution around the Economic Studies, Government Studies, and Foreign Policy Programs. In 1957, the Institution moved from Jackson Avenue to a new research center near Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C.&#91;24&#93;<br/>Kermit Gordon assumed the presidency of Brookings in 1967. He began a series of studies of program choices for the federal budget in 1969 entitled \"Setting National Priorities\". He also expanded the Foreign Policy Studies Program to include research in national security and defense. After the election of Richard Nixon to the presidency in 1968, the relationship between the Brookings Institution and the White House deteriorated; at one point Nixon's aide Charles Colson proposed a firebombing of the Institution.&#91;25&#93; Yet throughout the 1970s, Brookings was offered more federal research contracts than it could handle.&#91;26&#93;<br/>1980&#8211;2017<br/>Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at Brookings on 14 April 2010 while on a visit to the United States for the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit<br/>Jos&#233; Mar&#237;a Figueres, former President of Costa Rica, speaking at Brookings Institution<br/>By the 1980s, the Institution faced an increasingly competitive and ideologically charged intellectual environment.&#91;27&#93; The need to reduce the federal budget deficit became a major research theme as well as investigating problems with national security and government inefficiency. Bruce MacLaury,&#91;28&#93; fourth president of Brookings, also established the Center for Public Policy Education to develop workshop conferences and public forums to broaden the audience for research programs.&#91;29&#93;<br/>In 1995, Michael Armacost became the fifth president of the Brookings Institution and led an effort to refocus the Institution's mission heading into the 21st century.&#91;30&#93; Under Armacost's direction, Brookings created several interdisciplinary research centers, such as the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy (now the Metropolitan Policy Program, led by Bruce J. Katz),&#91;31&#93; which brought attention to the strengths of cities and metropolitan areas; and the Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, which brings together specialists from different Asian countries to examine regional problems.&#91;32&#93;<br/>Strobe Talbott became president of Brookings in 2002.&#91;33&#93; Shortly thereafter, Brookings launched the Saban Center for Middle East Policy and the John L. Thornton China Center. In October 2006, Bookings announced the establishment of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center in Beijing. In July 2007, the Institution announced the creation of the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform to be directed by senior fellow Mark McClellan,&#91;34&#93; and then in October 2007, the creation of the Brookings Doha Center directed by fellow Hady Amr in Qatar.&#91;35&#93; During this period the funding of Brookings by foreign governments and corporations came under public scrutiny (see Funding controversies below).<br/>In 2011, Brookings President Strobe Talbott inaugurated the Brookings India Office.&#91;36&#93;&#91;37&#93;<br/>In October 2017, former general John R. Allen became the seventh president of Brookings.&#91;38&#93;<br/>As of June 30, 2019, Brookings had an endowment of $377.2 million.&#91;39&#93;<br/>Publications<br/>Brookings as an institution produces an Annual Report.&#91;40&#93; The Brookings Institution Press publishes books and journals from the institution's own research as well as authors outside the organization.&#91;41&#93; The books and journals they publish include Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,&#91;42&#93; Brookings Review (1982&#8211;2003, ISSN 0745-1253),&#91;43&#93;&#91;44&#93; America Unbound: The Bush Revolution in Foreign Policy, Globalphobia: Confronting Fears about Open Trade, India: Emerging Power, Through Their Eyes, Taking the High Road, Masses in Flight, US Public Policy Regarding Sovereign Wealth Fund Investment in the United States&#91;45&#93; and Stalemate to name a few. In addition, books, papers, articles, reports, policy briefs and opinion pieces are produced by Brookings research programs, centers, projects and, for the most part, by experts.&#91;46&#93;&#91;47&#93; Brookings also cooperates with the Lawfare Institute in publishing the Lawfare blog.&#91;48&#93;<br/>Policy influence<br/>Brookings traces its history back to 1916 and has contributed to the creation of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan, and the Congressional Budget Office, as well as to the development of influential policies for deregulation, broad-based tax reform, welfare reform, and foreign aid.&#91;49&#93; The annual think tank index published by Foreign Policy ranks it the number one think tank in the U.S.&#91;50&#93; and the Global Go To Think Tank Index believes it is the number one such tank in the world.&#91;51&#93; Moreover, in spite of an overall decline in the number of times information or opinions developed by think tanks are referred to by the US media, of the 200 most prominent think tanks in the U.S., the Brookings Institution's research remains the most frequently cited.&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93;<br/>In a 1997 survey of congressional staff and journalists, Brookings ranked as the first-most influential and first in credibility among 27 think tanks considered.&#91;54&#93; Yet \"Brookings and its researchers are not so concerned, in their work, in affecting the ideological direction of the nation\" and rather tend \"to be staffed by researchers with strong academic credentials\".&#91;54&#93; Along with the Council on Foreign Relations and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Brookings is generally considered one of the most influential policy institutes in the U.S.&#91;55&#93;<br/>Political stance<br/>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, Brookings describes itself as independent and non-partisan. A 2005 academic study by UCLA concluded it was \"centrist\" because it was referenced as an authority almost equally by both conservative and liberal politicians in congressional records from 1993 to 2002.&#91;19&#93; The New York Times has referred to the organization as liberal, liberal-centrist, and centrist.&#91;56&#93;&#91;17&#93;&#91;57&#93;&#91;58&#93;&#91;59&#93;&#91;60&#93; The Washington Post has described Brookings as centrist and liberal.&#91;61&#93;&#91;62&#93;&#91;63&#93;&#91;64&#93; The Los Angeles Times has described Brookings as liberal-leaning and centrist before opining that it did not believe such labels mattered.&#91;65&#93;&#91;66&#93;&#91;67&#93;&#91;68&#93;<br/>In 1977, Time magazine described it as the \"nation's pre-eminent liberal think tank\".&#91;69&#93; Newsweek has described Brookings as centrist&#91;70&#93; while Politico has used the term \"center-left\".&#91;71&#93;<br/>The media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, which describes itself as \"progressive\",&#91;72&#93; has described Brookings as \"centrist\",&#91;52&#93;&#91;73&#93; \"conservative\",&#91;74&#93; and \"center-right\".&#91;75&#93;<br/>Journalists at The Atlantic and Salon have argued that Brookings foreign policy scholars were overly supportive of Bush administration policies abroad.&#91;76&#93;&#91;77&#93; Blogger Matthew Yglesias has stated that Brookings's Michael E. O'Hanlon frequently agrees with scholars from conservative organizations such as the American Enterprise Institute, The Weekly Standard, and the Project for the New American Century.&#91;76&#93; Similarly, Brookings fellow and research director Benjamin Wittes is a member of the conservative Hoover Institution's Task Force on National Security and Law.&#91;78&#93;<br/>Brookings scholars have served in Republican and Democratic administrations, including Mark McClellan,&#91;79&#93; Ron Haskins&#91;80&#93; and Martin Indyk.&#91;81&#93;&#91;82&#93;<br/>The Brookings Board of Trustees is composed of 53 Trustees and more than three dozen Honorary Trustees, including Kenneth Duberstein, a former chief of staff to Ronald Reagan. Aside from political figures, the board of trustees includes leaders in business and industry, including Philip H. Knight, Chairman of Nike, Inc, Robert Bass, Hanzade Do&#287;an Boyner, Paul L. Cejas, W. Edmund Clark, Abby Joseph Cohen, Betsy Cohen, Susan Crown, Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., Jason Cummins, Paul Desmarais Jr., Kenneth M. Duberstein, Glenn Hutchins.&#91;83&#93;<br/>Starting with the 1990 election cycle, employees of the Brookings Institution gave $853,017 to Democratic candidates and $26,104 to Republican candidates. In total, since 1990, 96 percent of its political donations have gone to Democrats.&#91;84&#93;<br/>Notable scholars<br/>Notable Brookings scholars include former Federal Reserve chairs Janet Yellen&#91;85&#93; and Ben Bernanke;&#91;86&#93; former Federal Reserve vice chairs Donald Kohn,&#91;87&#93; Alice Rivlin,&#91;88&#93; and Alan Blinder;&#91;89&#93; former chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) Jason Furman&#91;90&#93; and Martin Neil Baily;&#91;91&#93; former CEA members Sandra Black,&#91;92&#93; Jay Shambaugh,&#91;93&#93; and James H. Stock;&#91;94&#93; former director of the Congressional Budget Office Douglas Elmendorf;&#91;95&#93; former US secretary of education Arne Duncan;&#91;96&#93; former Assistant secretary of state Martin S. Indyk;&#91;97&#93; dean of the University of Michigan's Ford School of Public Policy Susan M.

Dionne;&#91;100&#93; Wall Street Journal columnist William Galston;&#91;101&#93; and former NSC official Fiona Hill.&#91;102&#93;<br/>Research programs<br/>Center for Middle East Policy<br/>In 2002, the Brookings Institution established the Center for Middle East Policy \"to promote a better understanding of the policy choices facing American decision-makers in the Middle East.<br/>Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy<br/>In 2006, the Brookings Institution established the Brookings-Tsinghua Center (BTC) for Public Policy as a partnership between the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC and Tsinghua University's School of Public Policy and Management in Beijing, China. The Center seeks to produce research in areas of fundamental importance for China's development and for US-China relations.&#91;103&#93; The BTC was directed by Qi Ye until 2019.&#91;104&#93;<br/>21st Century Defense Initiative<br/>Adm. Michael Mullen speaks at the Brookings Institution<br/>The 21st Century Defense Initiative (21CDI) is aimed at producing research, analysis, and outreach that address three core issues: the future of war, the future of U.S. defense needs and priorities, and the future of the US defense system.&#91;105&#93;<br/>The Initiative draws on the knowledge from regional centers, including the Center on the United States and Europe, the Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, the Thornton China Center, and the Center for Middle East Policy, allowing the integration of regional knowledge.&#91;106&#93;<br/>P. W. Singer, author of Wired for War, serves as Director of the 21st Century Defense Initiative, and Michael O'Hanlon serves as Director of Research.&#91;106&#93; Senior Fellow Stephen P. Cohen and Vanda Felbab-Brown&#91;107&#93; are also affiliated with 21CDI.&#91;108&#93;<br/>WashU at Brookings<br/>Under Brookings President Bruce MacLaury's leadership in the 1980s, the Center for Public Policy Education (CPPE) was formed to develop workshop conferences and public forums to broaden the audience for research programs. In 2005, the Center has renamed the Brookings Center for Executive Education (BCEE), which was shortened to Brookings Executive Education (BEE) with the launch of a partnership with the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis.

A former visiting fellow at a Brookings affiliate in Qatar reportedly said that \"he had been told during his job interview that he could not take positions critical of the Qatar government in papers\".&#91;112&#93; Brookings officials denied any connection between the views of their funders and their scholars' work, citing reports that questioned the Qatari government's education reform efforts and criticized its support of militants in Syria. However, Brookings officials reportedly acknowledged that they meet with Qatari government officials regularly.&#91;112&#93;<br/>In 2018, The Washington Post reported that the Brookings Institution accepted funding from Huawei from 2012 to 2018.&#91;115&#93; A report by the Center for International Policy's Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative of the top 50 think tanks on the University of Pennsylvania's Global Go-To Think Tanks rating index found that during the period 2014-2018 the Brookings Institution received the third-highest amount of funding from outside the United States compared to other think tanks, with a total of more than US$27 million.&#91;116&#93;<br/>Buildings<br/>The main building of the Institution was erected in 1959 on 1775 Massachusetts Avenue. In 2009, Brookings acquired a building across the street, a former mansion built by the Ingalls family in 1922 on a design by Jules Henri de Sibour.&#91;117&#93; This extension now houses the office of the President of the Brookings Institution.&#91;citation needed&#93;"},{"id":60,"title":"David Russow","group":"Person","image":"img/placeholder.png","value":1,"notes":""},{"id":61,"title":"NAM - National Academy of Medicine","group":"Organization","image":"img/NAM_-_National_Academy_of_Medicine.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Medicine\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Medicine</a><br/>The National Academy of Medicine (NAM), formerly called the Institute of Medicine (IoM) until 2015,&#91;1&#93; is an American nonprofit, non-governmental organization. The National Academy of Medicine is a part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, along with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Research Council (NRC).<br/>The National Academy of Medicine provides national and international advice on issues relating to health, medicine, health policy, and biomedical science. It aims to provide unbiased, evidence-based, and authoritative information and advice concerning health and science policy to policy-makers, professionals, leaders in every sector of society, and the public at large.<br/>Operating outside the framework of the U.S. federal government, it relies on a volunteer workforce of scientists and other experts, operating under a formal peer-review system. As a national academy, the organization annually elects new members with the help of its current members; the election is based on the members' distinguished and continuing achievements in a relevant field as well as for their willingness to participate actively.<br/>Contents<br/>1&#9;History<br/>2&#9;Overview<br/>3&#9;Awards<br/>4&#9;Notable members, past and present<br/>5&#9;See also<br/>6&#9;References<br/>7&#9;External links<br/>History<br/>The institute was founded in 1970, under the congressional charter of the National Academy of Sciences as the Institute of Medicine.&#91;2&#93;<br/>On April 28, 2015, NAS membership voted in favor of reconstituting the membership of the IOM as a new National Academy of Medicine and establishing a new division on health and medicine within the NRC that has the program activities of the IOM at its core. These changes took effect on July 1, 2015.&#91;1&#93;<br/>Overview<br/>The National Academies attempt to obtain authoritative, objective, and scientifically balanced answers to difficult questions of national importance.&#91;3&#93; The work is conducted by committees of volunteer scientists&#8212;leading national and international experts&#8212;who serve without compensation. Committees are chosen to assure the requisite expertise and avoid bias or conflict of interest. Every report produced by committee undergoes extensive review and evaluation by a group of external experts who are anonymous to the committee, and whose names are revealed only once the study is published. Victor Dzau is President and Chairman of the Council. His six-year term began on July 1, 2014. The Leonard D. Schaeffer Executive Officer is J. Michael McGinnis.<br/>The majority of studies and other activities are requested and funded by the federal government. Private industry, foundations, and state and local governments also initiate studies, as does the academy itself. Reports are made available online for free by the publishing arm of the United States National Academies, the National Academies Press, in multiple formats.<br/>The academy is both an honorific membership organization and a policy research organization. Its members, elected on the basis of their professional achievement and commitment to service, serve without compensation in the conduct of studies and other activities on matters of significance to health. Election to active membership is both an honor and a commitment to serve in Institute affairs. The bylaws specify that no more than 80 new members shall be elected annually, including 10 from outside the United States. The announcement of newly elected members occurs at the Annual Meeting in October. As of October 20, 2015, the number of regular members plus international and emeritus members is 2,012.&#91;2&#93; An unusual diversity of talent among NAM members is assured by the charter stipulation that at least one-quarter be selected from outside the health professions, from such fields as the natural, social, and behavioral sciences, as well as law, administration, engineering, and the humanities.<br/>The New York Times called the NAM (then called the IOM) the United States' \"most esteemed and authoritative adviser on issues of health and medicine, and its reports can transform medical thinking around the world.\"&#91;4&#93;<br/>Awards<br/>The Rhoda and Bernard Sarnat International Prize in Mental Health (Sarnat Prize) was established in 1992 and is awarded annually by the Academy to recognize individuals, groups, or organizations for outstanding achievement in improving mental health.

As of February 2018, its products were in use at more than 27,000 facilities around the world.&#91;5&#93; The company had more than 28,000 employees globally, with over 13,000 in Kansas City, Missouri. Its headquarters are in the suburb of North Kansas City, Missouri.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93;<br/>Contents<br/>1&#9;History<br/>2&#9;Products<br/>3&#9;Controversy<br/>3.1&#9;Canada<br/>3.2&#9;United Kingdom<br/>3.3&#9;United States<br/>4&#9;Locations<br/>5&#9;References<br/>6&#9;External links<br/>History<br/>Cerner was founded in 1979 by Neal Patterson, Paul Gorup, and Cliff Illig, who were colleagues at Arthur Andersen. Its original name was PGI & Associates but was renamed Cerner in 1984 when it rolled out its first system, PathNet.&#91;9&#93; It went public in 1986.&#91;10&#93; Cerner's client base grew steadily in the late 1980s, reaching 70 sites in 1987, 120 sites in 1988, 170 sites in 1989, and reaching 250 sites in 1990. Installations were primarily of PathNet systems.&#91;11&#93;<br/>During this time, Cerner was developing components of a Health Network Architecture (HNA), an integrated IT system designed to automate health care processes. Clients could purchase individual components or the whole system at one time. By 1994, more than 30 clients had purchased the full HNA system, while 100 clients had purchased multiple components of the system.&#91;11&#93;<br/>In 1997, the company introduced Cerner Millennium, an upgrade to its HNA system which incorporated all of the company's software offerings into one unified architecture. The introduction of Millennium contributed to significant growth for the company, with revenue increasing to $1.1 billion in 2005&#91;12&#93; from $245.1 million in 1997.&#91;13&#93;<br/>Cerner acquired IMC Health Care, Inc. in early 2010 to continue expanding its wellness services to outside commercial employers, pharmacies, and wellness programs.&#91;14&#93;<br/>In July 2010, president Trace Devanny left the company&#91;15&#93; and Patterson became the company's president, in addition to his roles as chairman and chief executive officer.&#91;16&#93; In September 2013, Zane Burke was named president, assuming the title from Patterson.&#91;17&#93;<br/>On August 5, 2014, Cerner announced its intent to purchase Siemens Health Services, the health information technology business of Germany's Siemens AG, for $1.3 billion.&#91;18&#93; The acquisition was completed on February 2, 2015.&#91;19&#93;<br/>On July 29, 2015, Leidos Partnership for Defense Health, which includes Cerner, Accenture, and Leidos, was awarded a 10-year, $4.3 billion contract to overhaul and manage the electronic health records for the Department of Defense.&#91;20&#93;<br/>CEO and co-founder Neal Patterson died July 9, 2017.&#91;1&#93;<br/>On January 10, 2018, Brent Shafer was named Chairman and CEO and took over leadership responsibilities in February 2018.&#91;21&#93;<br/>In July 2019, Cerner announced that it would partner with Amazon Web Services.&#91;22&#93;<br/>On September 4, 2019, Cerner laid off 255 employees as part of an ongoing cost-cutting effort and reorganization.&#91;23&#93;<br/>In February 2020, Cerner sold parts of its healthcare IT business in Germany and Spain to German company CompuGroup Medical SE for EUR 225 million (USD 247.5M).&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93;<br/>In 2020, Cerner announced the hire of three new C-suite executives including Jerome Labat as chief technology officer (CTO), Darrell Johnson as chief marketing officer (CMO) and William Mintz as chief strategy officer (CSO).&#91;22&#93;<br/>Products<br/>The company's products include:&#91;26&#93;<br/>Millennium+, a cloud hosted EHR<br/>Cerner FirstNet, emergency department system<br/>Cerner RadNet Radiology Information System (RIS)<br/>Cerner Learning Framework&#91;27&#93;<br/>The Cerner CCL (Cerner Command Language), is a SQL-like programming language developed by Cerner.<br/>Controversy<br/>In 2001, a memo authored by CEO Patterson and sent to about 400 managers was leaked online. The memo, written in harsh language, was meant to motivate the managers to get more productivity out of employees and promised layoffs, a hiring freeze, closing of an \"Associate Center,\" and the implementation of a punch-card system if Patterson did not see evidence of changes. Patterson's metric was the fullness of the company's Kansas City office lot at the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. The memo was widely seen as inflammatory and poor management, and Cerner's stock price fell 22% over three days.&#91;28&#93;<br/>In 2005, Cerner and other companies paid for a report by the RAND Corporation which predicted great efficiencies from electronic health records, including savings of $81 billion a year or more, which RAND now says is overstated. This report helped drive growth in the electronic health record and billions of dollars in federal incentives to hospitals and doctors. Cerner's revenue tripled from $1 billion in 2005 to a projected $3 billion in 2013. The study was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office for overstating potential savings. A 2013 reassessment of the 2005 report by the RAND Corporation said that the conversion had failed to produce savings and had mixed results in efficiency and patient care.&#91;29&#93;<br/>Canada<br/>In 2016, the Nanaimo BC hospital ER began using the system. Physicians and nurses have called it a \"huge failure\" with it increasing some types of errors and slowing down the emergency department.&#91;30&#93; The system cost CAN$ 230 million dollars.&#91;31&#93;<br/>United Kingdom<br/>In 2014, a Coroner ruled that a three-year-old heart patient died as a result of a delay to his treatment at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. The coroner ruled that the newly implemented Cerner Millennium booking system was responsible for the child not being seen or receiving treatment.&#91;32&#93;<br/>United States<br/>In 2002, the installation of a computerized health system by Cerner in the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh made it harder for the doctors and nurses to do their jobs in emergency situations and resulted in a \"disaster,\" according to Phillip Longman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. Longman wrote, \"According to a study conducted by the hospital and published in the journal Pediatrics, mortality rates for one vulnerable patient population&#8212;those brought by emergency transport from other facilities&#8212;more than doubled, from 2.8 percent before the installation to almost 6.6 percent afterward.\"&#91;33&#93; Defenders of Cerner in the study charged that the Pittsburgh hospital did not adequately prepare for the transition to the Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) system because it had simultaneously modified its pharmacy process, did not provide adequate wireless bandwidth, and did not have order sets pre-programmed on day one. They stated that other hospitals that more carefully planned the implementation did not experience the same problems.&#91;34&#93;<br/>In 2010, Girard Medical Center, Crawford County, Kansas, hired Cerner to install an electronic records system. But after receiving $1.3 million, Cerner employees failed to get the system running in time to qualify for federal incentive payments, and in September 2011, notified the hospital that it was abandoning the project, according to a lawsuit Girard filed against Cerner. Cerner and executives at Girard agreed that Girard did not have adequate staff to manage the acquisition and implementation of the system.&#91;35&#93; As of June 2014, the case remained in arbitration.&#91;29&#93;&#91;36&#93; The outcome of the Girard case will likely be kept confidential due to contract provisions.&#91;37&#93;<br/>In 2012, Trinity Health, a large hospital in North Dakota, sued Cerner, claiming that Cerner's patient accounting solution didn't work correctly; the parties settled for $106M in 2014.&#91;38&#93;<br/>In 2014, a grand jury in California found that Cerner knew that the Ventura County healthcare agency was unprepared to complete a $32 million installation. Also in 2014, a $31 million Cerner implementation at the Athens Regional Health System in Georgia had many problems, leading to forced resignations by the CEO and the CIO.&#91;36&#93;<br/>Locations<br/>Cerner's world headquarters campus is at 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City, Missouri.&#91;39&#93; It acquired additional space in Kansas City, Missouri in 2005&#91;40&#93; and in 2006 it acquired another location in Kansas City.&#91;41&#93; In 2013, Cerner announced plans to redevelop 236 acres in south Kansas City, Missouri into an office park. The site was previously occupied by Bannister Mall, which was demolished in 2009.&#91;42&#93; Cerner broke ground on the new campus on November 11, 2014. The $4.45 billion project intends to employ 16,000 new Cerner workers within the decade.&#91;43&#93;<br/>Cerner has offices in about 25 countries worldwide.&#91;44&#93;<br/>Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerner\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerner</a><br/>"},{"id":70,"title":"moderna","group":"Company","image":"img/moderna.png","value":1,"notes":"<br/>Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation &#8212; Advancing an mRNA-based antibody combination to help prevent HIV infection<br/>&#8220;Moderna Therapeutics&#8217; research has considerable potential for the development of an effective prevention intervention for HIV, and potentially other infectious diseases that disproportionately affect the world&#8217;s poorest people.&#8221; &#8211; Trevor Mundel, president of Global Health at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation<br/>In January 2016, we entered a global health project framework agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to advance mRNA-based development projects for various infectious diseases. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has committed up to $20.0 million in grant funding to support our initial project related to the evaluation of antibody combinations in a preclinical setting as well as the conduct of a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial of a potential mRNA medicine to help prevent human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, infections. Follow-on projects which could bring total potential funding under the framework agreement up to $100.0 million (including the HIV antibody project) to support the development of additional mRNA-based projects for various infectious diseases can be proposed and approved until the sixth anniversary of the framework agreement, subject to the terms of the framework agreement, including our obligation to grant to the Bill &Melinda Gates Foundation certain non-exclusive licenses.<br/>BARDA - Rapidly advancing a Zika mRNA vaccine<br/>In September 2016, we received an award of up to approximately $125 million from BARDA, a component of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to help fund our Zika vaccine program. Under the terms of the agreement with BARDA, an initial base award of approximately $8 million supported toxicology studies, a Phase 1 clinical trial, and associated manufacturing activities. Additionally, four contract options were awarded under the agreement with BARDA. Three out of four of these options have been exercised, bringing the total current award to approximately $117 million to support an additional Phase 1 study of an improved Zika vaccine candidate, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies, as well as large-scale manufacturing for the Zika vaccine.<br/>DARPA &#8211; Advancing mRNA therapies and vaccines for biodefense<br/>In October 2013, DARPA awarded Moderna up to approximately $25 million to research and develop potential mRNA medicines as a part of DARPA&#8217;s Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics, or ADEPT, program, which is focused on assisting with the development of technologies to rapidly identify and respond to threats posed by natural and engineered diseases and toxins.

Vir is a unique partnership that will allow us to leverage novel technologies to address these unmet needs together,&#8221; said Bill Gates.<br/>Chronic and acute infections impact hundreds of millions of people every year. For example, according to the World Health Organization, there are about 240 million people in the world living with chronic Hepatitis B, with millions of new infections annually. Millions contract seasonal influenza, resulting in three to five million severe cases and between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths. Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death globally&#8212;two billion have latent infection and ten million new cases occur annually. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, antibiotic resistant bacteria infect at least two million people and cause 23,000 deaths annually in the United States alone.<br/>Vir is adopting a broad technological portfolio, including the viral vectors obtained through the acquisition of TomegaVax, Inc. These technologies were originally developed by a team at Oregon Health & Science University, led by Louis Picker and Klaus Frueh, both grantees of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Vir&#8217;s own laboratory work is expected to take place in San Francisco, Boston and Portland, Oregon.<br/>About Vir<br/>Vir Biotechnology is investing in cures, treatments, and preventions for challenging viral and bacterial diseases, including those caused by drug-resistant bacteria and emerging pathogens.

We strive to help create a world where strong primary health care is the reality, not the exception, for every person, family and community.<br/>PHCPI was built on the belief that primary health care is the cornerstone of sustainable development, and that improving primary health care begins with better measurement. We work closely with governments and development partners who are looking to strengthen primary health care, providing them with the data, information and support they need to drive evidence-based improvements.<br/>Founded in 2015 by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Health Organization and the World Bank Group, in collaboration with Ariadne Labs and Results for Development and our newest partner UNICEF,  PHCPI draws on the strengths of our partners to work across the spectrum of primary health care measurement to improvement. PHCPI aims to ensure that data on primary health care is both accessible and used to drive decisions that change people&#8217;s lives. We are eager to work with additional partners who share our mission. <br/>Our Approach<br/>PHCPI supports stronger primary health care through three interconnected areas of work: Measurement, Improvement, and Engagement. <br/>Measurement<br/>PHCPI uses existing and emerging data to monitor and report on primary health care system performance, promote accountability, and help countries drive targeted improvements. PHCPI&#8217;s Conceptual Framework lays out the most important components of a strong primary health care system, showing the different elements of primary health care that countries should measure. Our set of 38 Core Indicators summarize existing comparable data on these elements. Our latest tool, the PHC Vital Signs Profiles &#8211; launched in October 2018 &#8211; goes one step further and provides the first-ever snapshot of the strength of primary health care systems in individual countries, shining a light on elements of the system that were previously overlooked. For more information on primary health care in specific countries, we invite you to access our data.<br/>Improvement<br/>Ultimately, PHCPI aims to use measurement for improvement and accountability. We&#8217;re committed to helping countries and development partners bridge the gap between measurement and improvement by providing relevant, useful information on what works to improve primary health care. In 2019, we launched the Improvement Strategies, an interactive knowledge tool that provides a selection of evidence-informed improvement options based on the current status of a country's primary health care system. We've also identified 19 Promising Practices -- lessons for how to build strong primary health care systems -- in countries around the world. And we work closely with the Joint Learning Network for Universal Health Coverage (JLN) and other global partner networks to develop tools that countries can use to improve primary health care.<br/>Engagement<br/>PHCPI works to elevate primary health care as a global priority by bringing together committed country-level policymakers, advocates and other development partners to help build strong primary health care systems and drive global and national attention to the issue.

Now, however, the world has set a new, exciting and ambitious goal for health &#8211; ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages &#8211; as part of the broader agenda for sustainable development. We now have an historic opportunity to transform aspiration into reality.<br/>The world has made tremendous health gains in recent decades. People are living longer than ever before, fewer children are dying in the early years of life, and access to lifesaving medicines and vaccines has skyrocketed. Yet it&#8217;s clear that meeting the health and development challenges of the twenty-first century requires a new approach &#8211; investing in health systems that can meet people&#8217;s diverse health needs at every age and every stage of life. <br/>Today, there&#8217;s growing recognition that strong primary health care is a cornerstone of sustainable development, and the key to building the future we all want and deserve. At recent global meetings on HIV/AIDS, noncommunicable diseases and tuberculosis, scientists, advocates and world leaders have recognized that stemming the tide on these epidemics begins with strong health systems that can address people&#8217;s complex and varied health needs side by side. And in October 2018, policymakers, advocates, patients and partners convened in Astana, Kazakhstan to commit to strong primary health care as the foundation and future of health for all.<br/> <br/>What is Strong Primary Health Care?<br/> <br/>Primary health care forms the foundation of health systems, ensuring all people stay healthy and get care when they need it. <br/>While primary health care looks different in every country, there are common building blocks that form the foundation of success. A strong primary health care system has facilities located in the right places in their communities, where people can go to access the primary care services they need when they need them; health care providers who are trained, empowered and incentivized to deliver quality primary care; and systems and policies that ensure essential medicines, vaccines and diagnostics are available and of high quality. Adequate funding underpins the success of the entire system and is essential to ensure countries can provide a basic package of primary care services for everyone, at a cost people can afford.<br/>When primary health care works, people and families are connected with trusted health workers and supportive systems throughout their lives, and have access to comprehensive services ranging from family planning and routine immunizations to treatment of illness and management of chronic conditions.<br/> <br/>Strong primary health care is the key to achieving health for all. <br/>Strong primary health care:<br/>Addresses more than 80 percent of people&#8217;s common health needs throughout their lives.<br/>Saves and improves lives, with fewer children dying before their fifth birthday, and more people living longer, healthier lives.<br/>Is efficient, detecting, preventing and managing people&#8217;s illnesses before they become expensive to treat.<br/>Is fair and equitable, providing all people with access to essential health services in their communities.<br/>Protects global health security, helping communities detect and stop local outbreaks before they become global epidemics. <br/>Strong primary health care also requires quality, easy-to-understand data to pinpoint strengths and weaknesses, and measure and monitor improvements. PHCPI is working to measure what matters &#8211; helping to shine a light on what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not, and ensuring decision makers have the data they need to strengthen primary care systems on the way to achieving health for all.<br/>"},{"id":80,"title":"Global Health Hub Germany","group":"Organization","image":"img/Global_Health_Hub_Germany.png","value":1,"notes":"GLOBAL HEALTH HUB GERMANY<br/>&#220;ber den Hub<br/>Der Global Health Hub Germany ist ein Netzwerk, das alle Akteure zusammenbringen will, die an Globaler Gesundheit interessiert sind.

The current Programmes at the Sanger Institute are Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation, Cellular Genetics, Human Genetics, Parasites and Microbes and Tree of Life. Studies from all programmes provide insights into human, pathogen, cellular evolution, the phenotypic and hence biological consequences of genome variation and the processes which cause mutations.<br/>Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation Programme<br/>Provides leadership in data aggregation and informatics innovation, develops high-throughput cellular models of cancer for genome-wide functional screens and drug testing, and explores somatic mutation's role in clonal evolution, ageing and development. This Programme includes the Cancer Genome Project.<br/>Cellular Genetics Programme<br/>Explores human gene function by studying the impact of genome variation on cell biology. Large-scale systematic screens are used to discover the impact of naturally occurring and engineered genome mutations in human induced pluripotent cells (hIPSCs), their differentiated derivatives and other cell types. It is one of the founder programmes driving the creation and organisation of the international Human Cell Atlas initiative.<br/>Human Genetics Programme<br/>The institute's research in human genetics focuses on the characterisation of human genetic variation in health and disease. Aside from the institute's contribution to the Human Genome Project, researchers at the Sanger Institute have made contributions in various research areas relating to disease, population comparative and evolutionary genetics. In January 2008, the launch of the 1000 Genomes Project, a collaboration with scientists around the globe, signalled an effort to sequence the genomes of 1000 individuals in order to create the \"most detailed map of human genetic variation to support disease studies\".&#91;25&#93; The data from the pilot projects was made freely available in public databases in June 2010.&#91;26&#93; In 2010, the Sanger Institute announced its participation in the UK10K project,&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93; which will sequence the genomes of 10,000 individuals to identify rare genetic variants and their effects on human health. The Sanger Institute is also part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium, an international effort to describe different cancer tumour types.&#91;30&#93; It is also part of the GENCODE and ENCODE research programmes&#91;31&#93; to create an encyclopaedia of DNA elements.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>The Programme applies genomics to population-scale studies to identify the causal variants and pathways involved in human disease and their effects on cell biology. It also models developmental disorders to explore which physical aspects might be reversible.<br/>Pathogens and Microbes Programme<br/>Investigates the common underpinning mechanisms of evolution, infection and resistance to therapy into bolster understanding of bacteria, viruses and parasites, with a particular interest in malaria. It also explores the effects of genome variation on the biology of host-pathogen interactions, in particular host response to infection and the role of microiotia in health and disease. All the genomes after sequencing are made available at the web-based onsite-maintained database, GeneDB.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>Tree of Life Programme<br/>The Tree of Life Programme was created in 2019 to investigate the diversity of complex organisms found in the UK through sequencing and cellular technologies. It also compares and contrasts species' genome sequences to unlock insights into evolution and conservation. This Programme will play a leading role in the Darwin Tree of Life Project, a UK-wide initiative to sequence the genomes of all 66,000 complex species (eukaryotes) in the British Isles.<br/>Collaborations<br/>Much of the Sanger Institute's research is carried out in partnership with the wider scientific community; over 90 percent of the institute's research papers involve collaborations with other organisations.&#91;32&#93; Significant collaborations include:<br/>1000 Genomes Project<br/>GENCODE and ENCODE (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements)<br/>International Cancer Genome Consortium<br/>International HapMap Project&#91;33&#93;<br/>International Knockout Mouse Consortium<br/>International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium<br/>SNP (Single nucleotide polymorphism) Consortium<br/>The Copy Number Variation Project&#91;34&#93;<br/>The genome sequencing of S. pombe, C. elegans, mouse and the Malaria parasite.<br/>The Human Genome Project<br/>The UK 10,000 Genomes Project (UK10K)&#91;35&#93;<br/>Wellcome Trust - Department of Biotechnology, India Alliance&#91;36&#93;<br/>Public engagement<br/>Children at a public outreach event thread bracelets in four colours to spell out a DNA sequence.<br/>The Sanger Institute has a programme of public engagement activity. The programme aims to make complex biomedical research accessible to a range of audiences including school students and their teachers, and local community members.<br/>The Communication and Public Engagement programme aims to \"encourage informed discussion about issues relevant to Sanger Institute research\"&#91;37&#93; and \"foster a community of researchers who can engage effectively with different audiences\".&#91;37&#93; The institute hosts visits for more than 1,500 students, teachers and community groups per year. Visitors may meet scientific staff, tour the Institute and its facilities, and participate in ethical debates and activities. The programme also offers professional development sessions for teachers of GCSE and post 16 science through the national network of Science Learning Centres, and by hosting visits for groups interested in updating their knowledge in contemporary genetics. Videoconferencing into the Sanger Institute is also offered for Science Learning Centres, Science Centres and schools.<br/>Scientific and public engagement staff also collaborate on and contribute to national projects such as the UK's InsideDNA&#91;38&#93; traveling exhibition and the Who am I? gallery at The Science Museum.&#91;39&#93; They also participate in public events such as the Cambridge Science Festival.<br/>Graduate training<br/>The institute operates two PhD training programmes: a four-year course for basic science graduates, and a three-year course for clinicians. The four-year course requires students to rotate around three different laboratories in order to broaden their scientific horizons before choosing a PhD project. Each student is required to choose at least one experimental and one informatics-based rotation project.&#91;40&#93; The Institute houses approximately 50 pre-doctoral students, all of whom are registered at the University of Cambridge.&#91;41&#93;<br/>Officers<br/>According to Companies House the five officers of the parent company Genome Research Limited are Henry Parkinson, Kay Elizabeth Davies, Rolf Dieter Heuer, James Cuthbert Smith, David Lindsay Willetts.&#91;42&#93; According to the Sanger website Henry Parkinson is head of legal.&#91;43&#93;<br/>Staff<br/>As of 2015 the Sanger employs around 900 people, and is led by Michael Stratton. Notable scientific staff, faculty and alumni are listed below:<br/>Academic faculty<br/>As of 2019 a faculty of 32 scientists lead hypothesis-driven research, seeking answers to biomedical questions.&#91;44&#93; Among others, these include Dominic Kwiatkowski, Nicole Soranzo, Michael Stratton, Sarah Teichmann and Matthew Hurles.

Sulston was the founding director of the Sanger Institute. Sulston was instrumental in the choice of the Hinxton site for the Institute and remained there as Director until the announcement of the completion of the draft human genome in 2000.&#91;49&#93; Sulston graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1963 and completed his PhD on the chemical synthesis of DNA in 1966.&#91;50&#93; He shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Robert Horvitz and Sydney Brenner,&#91;51&#93; two years after standing down as director of the institute.<br/>In 2000, Allan Bradley left his appointment as professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, in the US, to take up the position as director of the Sanger Institute. Bradley wanted to build on the achievements made by the Sanger Institute in the Human Genome Project by \"concentrating on gene function, cancer genomics, and the genomes of model organisms such as the mouse and the zebrafish\".&#91;52&#93; Bradley received his BA, MA and PhD in Genetics from the University of Cambridge.&#91;53&#93;&#91;54&#93;&#91;55&#93;&#91;56&#93;<br/>In 2010, Bradley stepped down from his leadership role to form a startup company, but remains on the faculty of the Institute as director emeritus. Mike Stratton, who is a leader of the Cancer Genome Project and the International Cancer Genome Consortium, was appointed Director of the Sanger Institute in May of that year.&#91;57&#93;<br/>Human Genome Project<br/>The Sanger Institute was opened in 1993, three years after the inception of the Human Genome Project, and went on to make the largest single contribution to the gold standard sequence of the human genome, published in 2004.&#91;58&#93; The institute was engaged in collaborations to sequence 8 of the 23 human pairs of chromosomes (1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 20, 22, and X).&#91;59&#93; Since the publishing of the human genome, research carried out at the institute has developed beyond sequencing of organisms into various biomedical research areas, including studies into diseases such as cancer, malaria and diabetes.<br/>Controversy<br/>In August 2018 it was reported that an investigation was under way into allegations of bullying of staff and gender discrimination made against senior management of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, including the director.&#91;60&#93; The investigation, carried out by the barrister Thomas Kibling from Matrix Chambers, concluded in October 2018 and cleared Stratton of any wrongdoing, while listing areas for improvement in the workings of the Sanger Institute.&#91;61&#93;&#91;62&#93; The findings and the independence of the investigation were disputed.&#91;63&#93;<br/>In October 2019 it was reported that the institute had manufactured a medical tool with the intent of monetising it despite not having ethical nor legal approval to do so and having been made aware by Stellenbosch University and internal whistleblowers.&#91;64&#93;<br/>References"},{"id":86,"title":"Bank Information Center (BIC)","group":"Organization","image":"img/Bank_Information_Center_(BIC).png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://bankinformationcenter.org/\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://bankinformationcenter.org/</a><br/><a href=\"https://www.devex.com/organizations/bank-information-center-bic-37238\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.devex.com/organizations/bank-information-center-bic-37238</a>"},{"id":87,"title":"DSW - Deutsche Stiftung Weltbevoelkerung","group":"Organization","image":"img/DSW_-_Deutsche_Stiftung_Weltbevoelkerung.png","value":1,"notes":"Die DSW wurde 1991 von den hannoverschen Unternehmern Erhard Schreiber und Dirk Ro&#223;mann mit dem Ziel gegr&#252;ndet, einen Beitrag zur Umsetzung des Menschenrechts auf Familienplanung und zur Verlangsamung des Bev&#246;lkerungswachstums zu leisten.<br/>Schon in den ersten Jahren wurde deutlich, dass die Jugendlichen der Schl&#252;ssel f&#252;r eine zukunftsf&#228;hige Bev&#246;lkerungsentwicklung sind.

The IRC is currently working in about 40 countries and 26 U.S. cities where it resettles refugees and helps them become self-sufficient.&#91;4&#93; It focuses mainly on health, education, economic wellbeing, power, and safety.<br/>Consisting of first responders, humanitarian relief workers, international development experts, health care providers, and educators, the IRC has assisted millions of people around the world since its founding in 1933. In 2016, 26 million people in about 40 countries and 26 U.S. cities benefited from IRC programs.&#91;5&#93;<br/>The current President of the International Rescue Committee is former British Foreign Secretary David Miliband (2013&#8211;present).&#91;6&#93;<br/>Contents<br/>1&#9;History<br/>1.1&#9;Founding<br/>1.2&#9;Timeline<br/>1.2.1&#9;1940s<br/>1.2.2&#9;1950s<br/>1.2.3&#9;1960s<br/>1.2.4&#9;1970s<br/>1.2.5&#9;1980s<br/>1.2.6&#9;1990s<br/>1.2.7&#9;2000s<br/>1.2.8&#9;2010s<br/>1.2.9&#9;2020s<br/>2&#9;Current work<br/>2.1&#9;Democratic Republic of the Congo<br/>2.2&#9;Iraq<br/>3&#9;Operations<br/>3.1&#9;Emergency response<br/>3.2&#9;Health programs<br/>3.3&#9;Gender-based anti-violence programs<br/>3.4&#9;Post-conflict development<br/>3.5&#9;Programs for children<br/>3.6&#9;Resettling refugees<br/>3.7&#9;Advocacy<br/>4&#9;Organization<br/>5&#9;Finances<br/>6&#9;Reports<br/>7&#9;See also<br/>8&#9;References<br/>9&#9;External links<br/>History<br/>The International Rescue Committee (IRC) was the American branch of the International Relief Association (which later combined with another relief organization), which was founded by Albert Einstein in 1931.&#91;7&#93; The IRC was initially an organization that helped those who were fleeing Nazi Germany and as need arose it expanded its clientele.<br/>Founding<br/>The International Relief Association (IRA) was founded in 1931 in Germany by two left-wing factions, the Communist Party Opposition (KPO) and the Socialist Workers Party (SAP). Its purpose was to aid victims of state oppression and persecution.&#91;8&#93; After the Nazis took power in 1933, the organization moved its headquarters to Paris.&#91;9&#93;<br/>The KPO consisted of the 'right opposition' &#8211; communists who had been purged by Stalin in 1929 because of their support for Nikolai Bukharin. Among those purged was Jay Lovestone, the erstwhile head of the American Communist Party. It was Lovestone who formed an American section of the International Relief Association in 1933. Among those who joined him was Albert Einstein. Its purpose was to assist Germans suffering under Adolf Hitler's government &#8211; particularly supporters of the 'right opposition'. Later, refugees from Mussolini's Italy and Franco's Spain were assisted.<br/>In 1940, European exiles and American liberals close to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, founded the Emergency Rescue Committee (ERC) to aid European refugees trapped in Vichy France. ERC founding member Varian Fry arrived in Marseilles within a few weeks of the fall of France, where he pulled together a small team that was instrumental in helping many individuals escape Vichy and the Nazis to safety in the U.S. and elsewhere. Over 2,000 political, cultural, union and academic leaders were rescued in just 13 months, ending when Fry was expelled by the Vichy French. Fry also worked closely with British intelligence, helping to establish escape routes for British servicemen. Fry also took a map showing the distribution of mines in the Meditarranean that he received from a refugees and gave it to an agent of British intelligence.&#91;10&#93;<br/>In 1942, after the US entered the Second World War, IRA and ERC joined forces under the name International Relief and Rescue Committee, which was later shortened to the International Rescue Committee.&#91;11&#93; The organization was financed largely by the National War Fund. According to historian Eric Thomas Chester, by the 1950s the IRC had evolved into a global operation functioning as an integral link in the CIA's covert network, became deeply involved in the volatile confrontations between the two superpowers, and participated in an array of sensitive clandestine operations.&#91;12&#93;<br/>Timeline<br/>1940s<br/>In the 1940s, IRC fed people during the Soviet blockade of West Berlin.&#91;13&#93; In 1945, at the end of World War II, the IRC initiated emergency relief programs, established hospitals and children's centers, and started refugee resettlement efforts in Europe. With the descent of the Iron Curtain in 1946, the IRC initiated a resettlement program for East European refugees, which continued until the end of the Cold War.&#91;11&#93; In the period immediately following the end of the Second World War, the IRC was one of several organizations aiding refugees from Eastern Europe. These refugees were screened to see if they had valuable information concerning the Soviet bloc countries. A select few were recruited to participate in covert operations being conducted by the intelligence community.&#91;14&#93; In 1949, the IRC took a significant step toward a greater integration into the covert network. The IRC distributed a confidential memorandum that it was prepared to take part in sensitive covert operatons at the behest of the U.S. government. Only a select few within the Committee would be told of these operations. From this point onward, the IRC would function on a two-pronged basis. There would be programs to assist refugees that would be transparent and, at the same time, there would be parallel operations known to only a few.&#91;15&#93;<br/>1950s<br/>In 1950, the IRC intensified its aid in Europe with Project Berlin, which provided food to the people of East Berlin amid increased Soviet oppression. After the war, the Committee's European representatives focused on rebuilding the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) as a bulwark against the Communists.&#91;8&#93;<br/>Leo Cherne, an IRC board member since 1946, was elected IRC Chairman in 1951. He would hold the position for 40 years.<br/>Also in the 1950s, the IRC began relief and resettlement programs for refugees displaced by the North Vietnamese defeat of the French and by the Soviet forces&#8217; crushing of the Hungarian revolution.&#91;11&#93; According to historian Eric Thomas Chester, the IRC was instrumental in the establishment of two key Washington lobby groups supporting South Vietnam, the American Friends of Vietnam, and its successor, the Citizens Committee for Peace with Freedom in Vietnam.&#91;16&#93;&#91;8&#93;<br/>1960s<br/>In 1960, an IRC resettlement program began for Cuban refugees fleeing the Castro dictatorship and for Haitian refugees escaping the Duvalier regime.<br/>IRC operations were extended to Africa in 1962 when 200,000 Angolans fled to Zaire. Also that year, the IRC began aiding Chinese fleeing to Hong Kong from the mainland.&#91;11&#93;<br/>1970s<br/>The IRC was active worldwide, providing support for refugees fleeing conflict and oppression in India, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Guatemala, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Uganda and the Soviet Union, while resettling refugees in the United States.&#91;11&#93;<br/>1980s<br/>At the turn of the decade, the IRC launched emergency relief programs for Afghan refugees fleeing to Pakistan. Eight years later, the IRC started community rehabilitation activities in Afghanistan for tens of thousands of returning refugees.<br/>During the 1982 war in Lebanon, the IRC assisted Palestinian and Lebanese refugees.<br/>Spanish Refugee Aid, which served the survivors of the Spanish Civil War in France, became a division of the IRC in 1984. That same year, the IRC initiated health and community development projects in El Salvador for displaced victims of the civil war.<br/>Partnering with the Polish trade union movement Solidarity in 1987, the IRC began a health care program in Poland.<br/>Relief programs to assist Mozambican refugees in Malawi also began in 1987. Eight years later, the IRC was in Mozambique helping with their return.<br/>In 1989, the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children was established by the IRC as an affiliate organization whose purpose is to serve the rights and interests of the 80% of the world's refugees who are women and children. The Women's Commission became the Women's Refugee Commission in 2009.&#91;11&#93;<br/>1990s<br/>After the first Gulf War, the IRC came to the aid of hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees who fled Saddam Hussein's regime. In 1992, the IRC began work in the former Yugoslavia, first dealing with the consequences of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina and later launching community rehabilitation programs in Bosnia.<br/>IRC became headquartered in the Chanin Building in midtown Manhattan in 1994.&#91;17&#93; In 1994, the IRC set up emergency programs in Tanzania and Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) to aid refugees fleeing genocide and civil war in Rwanda.<br/>IRC operations began inside Kosovo in 1997 and were expanded in 1999 to meet the needs of Kosovar refugees in Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro and Bosnia. Also in 1997, the IRC opened a UK office.<br/>In 1999, the IRC launched emergency operations in East Timor.&#91;11&#93;<br/>2000s<br/>In 2000, the IRC launched emergency shelter, sanitation and education programs for Chechen refugees fleeing fighting between Russian forces and separatist Chechen rebels.<br/>Following the September 11 attacks, the IRC undertook an advocacy campaign to reverse the U.S. government's slowdown in refugee resettlement.&#91;18&#93;<br/>The IRC responded to the war in Iraq by providing water and sanitation and health care support from 2003 to 2005. In 2007, the IRC launched a campaign to aid and support displaced Iraqis.<br/>In 2003, IRC programs in West Africa expanded to serve the growing populations of refugees and displaced persons uprooted by civil conflict.<br/>In 2005, around two decades after Burmese refugees first began crossing into Thailand, poverty and violent conflict in Myanmar's ethnic minority areas continue to drive people into camps along the border. Since its opening in 2005, by 2012 the Resettlement Support Center (formerly known as the Overseas Processing Entity) in the Thai capital Bangkok had helped 90,000 people seek admission to the United States as refugees. The Resettlement Support Center primarily assists refugees in Thailand but also assists asylum seekers in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia. The activities of the center are funded by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.&#91;19&#93;<br/>The IRC worked closely with local aid organizations to respond to various disasters, including in Pakistan after the 2005 earthquake;&#91;20&#93; and in Indonesia after the South Asian tsunami; and in Myanmar after the 2008 cyclone.<br/>In 2008, the IRC released the fifth in a series of surveys demonstrating the excess loss of life in the Democratic Republic of Congo caused by the nation's long-running civil war.

It had an annual operating budget of around $700 million.&#91;17&#93; In 2016, the IRC aided around 15,000 women and girls through protection and empowerment programs in Jordan.&#91;23&#93; In 2016 the IRC published the \"Outcomes and Evidence Framework,\"&#91;24&#93; an interactive tool that aims to create a framework for guiding humanitarian decision-making using theories of change and research evidence. The same year, they publicly committed to using this tool to ensure that all of their programs are evidence-based or evidence-generating by 2020 as part of the \"Grand Bargain\" commitments.&#91;25&#93;<br/>In July 2018, IRC was behind the Welcome Home initiative to give tours and activities for refugees in New York City and Northern California.&#91;26&#93;<br/>In 2019, the IRC in San Diego began hosting a \"Refugee Film Festival\" that presents documentaries about the refugee experience.&#91;27&#93;<br/>2020s<br/>On March 13, 2020, the second annual IRC's Refugee Film Festival in San Diego was postponed until June due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&#91;28&#93;<br/>Current work<br/>The IRC is now at work in about 40 countries and in 26 U.S. cities.&#91;29&#93; In 2010, notable operations included disaster response in the wake of the earthquake in Haiti, ongoing programs to address the humanitarian crisis in Congo and to help community rebuilding efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and advocacy and resettlement efforts on behalf of Iraqis uprooted by the war.<br/>The organization was involved in responding to a massacre in Bani Walid, Libya, where near a hundred young men attempting to escape a militia were gunned down.&#91;30&#93;<br/>On August 5, 2018, it was reported that the agency had lowered its staff number in Georgia after refugee arrivals decreased.&#91;31&#93;<br/>Democratic Republic of the Congo<br/>Foreign Secretary William Hague and UNHCR Special Envoy Angelina Jolie at Nzolo displacement camp, near Goma, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, 25 March 2013, meeting refugees and the International Rescue Committee<br/>The IRC is one of the largest providers of humanitarian assistance in the DRC, where conflict and humanitarian crisis have taken the lives of 5.4 million people since 1998, according to peer-reviewed studies by the IRC. The organization runs programs dedicated to health, education, civil society development, emergency response and reducing gender-based violence, in seven Congolese provinces. As rape and other forms of sexual violence have increasingly been used as a tactic of war by militias involved in the conflict, the IRC has stepped up its sexual violence aid and protection programs. Between 2002 and 2018, the IRC has provided medical care, counseling and economic support services to about 40,000 women and girls who have survived sexual violence in Congo.&#91;32&#93;&#91;self-published source&#93;&#91;dead link&#93;<br/>The IRC is at the origin of a controversial estimate of the excess mortality in the DRC due to conflicts following the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda. According to the IRC at first, the excess mortality was estimated at 3.8 million deaths.&#91;33&#93; This estimate was challenged by a group of Belgian demographers sent to the DRC by a European institution to help draw up electoral lists for the DRC.&#91;34&#93; For cross-checking purposes, they made a study of the excess mortality in the DRC over the period 1998-2004 which came to 183,000 deaths, twenty times less.&#91;35&#93;<br/>Iraq<br/>Yazidi refugees from Iraq receive aid from the IRC at Newroz camp, Syria, 13 August 2014<br/>The IRC conducted operations across Iraq from April 2003 through December 2004.

In addition to aiding displaced Iraqis within the country, the IRC is also providing assistance to Iraqi refugees in Jordan and Syria, as well as to those granted refuge in the United States.&#91;36&#93;<br/>Operations<br/>The IRC delivers a number of services, including emergency response, health care, programs fighting gender-based violence, post-conflict development projects, children and youth protection and education programs, water and sanitation systems, strengthening the capacity of local organizations, and supporting civil society and good-governance initiatives.<br/>For refugees afforded sanctuary in the United States, IRC resettlement offices&#91;37&#93; across the country provide a range of assistance aimed at helping new arrivals settling, adjusting and acquiring the skills to become self-sufficient.<br/>The IRC also engages in advocacy efforts on behalf of the oppressed and displaced, and its annual Freedom Award recognizes \"extraordinary contributions to the cause of refugees and human freedom.\"<br/>The IRC has spearheaded a campaign urging the United States to pass the International Violence Against Women Act, which is now before Congress.&#91;38&#93; The organization has also advocated for the United States to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child;&#91;39&#93; 196 nations have signed this UN convention; the US is the only UN nation which so far has not.<br/>Emergency response<br/>The IRC maintains an Emergency Response Team of 17 specialists who assess survival needs and mount responses to sudden or protracted emergencies.<br/>The team includes coordinators, logisticians, doctors, and water and sanitation experts. It also includes specialists who focus on human rights protection, the special needs of children in crisis, the prevention of sexual violence, and aid for rape survivors.<br/>Emergency Response Team members remain on standby to deploy to a crisis within 72 hours, whether they are launching new relief efforts or lending support to IRC teams already on the ground. Equipment and supplies are pre-positioned in key transport hubs so that the materials can be dispatched anywhere in the world on short notice. The IRC also maintains a kit with inventory necessary for the startup of an emergency program in a remote location, as well as a roster of IRC employees and qualified external personnel who are available on short notice for emergency deployment.<br/>Recent IRC Emergency Response Team deployments include Darfur,&#91;40&#93; Indonesia after the South Asian tsunami, Myanmar after the 2008 cyclone, and Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.<br/>Health programs<br/>An IRC doctor conducting a check-up on a young Syrian refugee, Ramtha, Jordan, 28 August 2013<br/>During emergencies, the IRC endeavors to rapidly reduce illness and death rates to normal levels.

The overwhelming majority of cases involve women and girls. The IRC's gender-based anti-violence programs aim to meet the safety, health, psychosocial and justice needs of women and girls who are survivors of or vulnerable to gender-based violence. In partnership with communities and institutions, the IRC works to empower communities to lead efforts that challenge beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that perpetuate or condone violence against women and girls.<br/>IRC programs implement and support social work services to help individual survivors of gender-based violence, economic empowerment activities to support survivors of violence and women and girls at-risk of violence,&#91;41&#93; community education and mobilization projects around gender-based violence, training and capacity-building for NGOs and governments, coordination of humanitarian services, and advocacy efforts to advance laws preventing violence against women, and the enforcement of policies ensuring survivors&#8217; access to care and legal justice.<br/>Post-conflict development<br/>A group of women learning to create a fishing net via an IRC program, Northern Lebanon, 6 November 2013<br/>The IRC assists with post-conflict recovery by supporting conflict-impacted communities and countries in their transition to sustainable peace and development.<br/>In addition to the provision of humanitarian assistance, IRC post-conflict development projects aim to restore and strengthen physical and social institutions, as well as rebuild and restore social cohesion.<br/>Program areas include social programs emphasizing rebuilding the health, public infrastructure and education sectors; gender-based violence programs; economic recovery and development programs; and governance programs that support civil society, enhance protection and the rule of law, and rebuild ties between governments and their constituencies.<br/>Programs for children<br/>In 2016, the IRC and its partners helped provide over 1.5 million children with access to educational opportunities.&#91;42&#93; The IRC promotes the protection and development of children and youth from the early stages of an emergency through post-conflict and recovery. Its children's and youth programs include emergency care;&#91;43&#93; formal and non-formal education; rehabilitation and community reintegration of former child soldiers; psychosocial care and protection; life skills training, recreational and cultural activities; and economic and leadership development for youth.<br/>Resettling refugees<br/>The IRC's 22 regional offices help to resettle newly arrived refugees in the U.S. and provide various services to refugees, asylees and victims of human trafficking.<br/>Resettlement services include providing immediate aid, including food and shelter; assisting with job placement and employment skills; and giving access to clothing, medical attention, education, English-language classes and community orientation.<br/>In addition to integrating refugees into the U.S., the IRC also provides immigration services to refugees and people who have been granted asylum, as well as specialized services to victims of human trafficking in the U.S.<br/>Advocacy<br/>The IRC seeks to focus the attention of policy makers on humanitarian crises and the needs of refugees, internally displaced people and other victims of conflict.<br/>Organization<br/>The current president and CEO of the IRC is David Miliband, formerly British Foreign Secretary.<br/>Miliband's predecessor as president was George Erik Rupp, a former president of Columbia University and of Rice University.

The American Institute of Philanthropy gives the IRC an A rating;&#91;48&#93; the Forbes Investment Guide named the IRC one of 10 gold star charities,&#91;49&#93; and in its 2009 review of American charities, Forbes magazine gave the IRC high ratings for program and fundraising efficiency,&#91;50&#93; however, in 2020 Forbes dropped IRC to 48th in its top 100 list;&#91;51&#93; Charity Navigator gave the IRC its top rating of four stars every year from 2006 to 2018 (but has downgraded them to three stars for 2019, likely due to a new, less transparent, donor privacy policy);&#91;52&#93; and the Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance reports that the IRC meets all of its 20 Standards for Charity Accountability.&#91;53&#93;<br/>Because of its generally good reputation therefore it came as a shock when in March 2021, the Department of Justice&#91;54&#93; District of Columbia fined International Rescue Committee USD 6.9 Million for its failure to maintain adequate oversight &#91;55&#93; and for procurement fraud by engaging in collusive Behavior and Misconduct on Programs Funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).<br/>Finances<br/>As of 2019, the IRC reportedly held $224,275,287 in net assets, with funding coming from private and institutional donors. U.S. government funding of the IRC's programs originates from the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (BPRM), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). A breakdown of the IRC's financial report for the year 2016 shows that the largest program service investment was in health services, which absorbed 38% of the IRC's funds for the year.&#91;56&#93; According to Charity Navigator, in 2019, more than 87 cents of every $1 received by IRC went to programs and services that directly affected their clientele.&#91;57&#93;<br/>Reports<br/>The IRC issued a report in 2008 detailing the plight of Iraqi refugees on the five-year anniversary of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq.&#91;58&#93;<br/>The next year, the organization followed up with a report on the plight of Iraqi refugees in the United States. The report argued that while \"resettlement continues to be a critical and lifesaving intervention for thousands of at-risk Iraqi refugees who are living in precarious conditions in exile and unable to return home safely&#8230;the federal program no longer meets the basic needs of today&#8217;s newly arriving refugees and requires urgent reform.\"&#91;59&#93;<br/>In 2010, the IRC's Commission on Iraqi Refugees issued a third report on displaced Iraqis entitled, \"A Tough Road Home: Uprooted Iraqis in Jordan, Syria and Iraq.\" The report asserted that Iraqis are trapped in poverty and uncertainty and their needs are growing more acute, even as international attention and assistance wanes. The IRC's recommendations included increasing aid for the displaced, intensifying efforts to create conditions that would enable people to go home safely and accelerating resettlement for those who cannot go back.&#91;60&#93;<br/>In a series of five ground-breaking mortality surveys between 2000 and 2007, the IRC documented the devastating impact of the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The most recent report estimated that 5.4 million people had died from conflict-related causes in Congo since 1998, and 2.1 million of those deaths occurred after the formal end of the war in 2002.&#91;61&#93; These statistics are often cited by media and nongovernmental agencies reporting on the humanitarian crisis in Congo."},{"id":89,"title":"Exemplars Health","group":"Organization","image":"img/Exemplars_Health.png","value":1,"notes":"<br/>----------------------<br/><a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/exemplars-global-health-niranjan-bose\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/exemplars-global-health-niranjan-bose</a><br/>Gates Ventures&#8212;in partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation&#8212;just launched the Exemplars in Global Health platform, which is available at www.exemplars.health. What is Exemplars in Global Health?<br/>Just like in any field, it&#8217;s important in global health to learn from positive outliers: Countries that have outperformed their peers. Having an objective assessment of what led to one country&#8217;s success helps other countries discover replicable lessons and improve their own performance.<br/>Exemplars in Global Health is an international research collaboration for doing just that. Working with partners, we have researched exemplars in several topic areas like stunting and child mortality reduction and created a web platform where our content is curated and kept current. Beyond the web platform, we also work directly with global health leaders around the world to help them adapt lessons from exemplars to the context in their country.<br/>For any given topic, we start with a topic overview: Why is it a global challenge? Who are the positive outliers? We then go into the stories from each country, from what was achieved, how was it achieved, to who played a role, and what gaps still exist today.<br/>Since we have half a dozen or so countries for each topic, we also provide cross-country synthesis that outlines the &#8220;no-regret&#8221; things to do if you're a region or country and plan to embark on this journey.<br/>Why is it so important to study Exemplars? What gap does that fill?<br/>We&#8217;ve always looked at what works in global health. For instance, the Lancet Nutrition Series tells you what interventions to use to get really good outcomes in nutrition and reduce stunting levels. But it doesn't tell you how countries that have succeeded actually did it. Every country in the world knows about the interventions and has programs built to deliver them, but some countries seem to be achieving faster health gains than others. We need more understanding of the implementation elements of success: How is one country getting these interventions to work so well when their neighbors might not be?<br/>A lot of interventions proposed by the global health community are derived from randomized control trials.<br/>But when you flip the question and say, let's just look at 10 years, 20 years of progress in the real world, you might get slightly different answers.<br/>For instance, in our stunting reduction research, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) comes up as a key intervention. But when you do a randomized control trial, WASH doesn't come up partly because of the time-limited duration of these trials, which usually last only three or four years. When you look at a decade or two decades worth of progress, additional insights come out.<br/>For funders, this means you can't measure the impact in just three years or four years. You might have to have a program that's more holistic over the course of a decade.<br/>A lot of interventions proposed by the global health community are derived from randomized control trials.

The platform is just one part of our toolkit.<br/>We have a suite of tools to help users get the most out of the content. The country comparison tool helps you decide if you should be learning from country A, B, or C. The data explorer lets you build your own visualizations. And the Report Builder allows you to customize the content you want to read or share with others.<br/>There are also community-oriented tools, which allow users to ask questions of our expert network and even to contribute to the platform via annotations. We believe this interactivity is really important.<br/>Offline, we can connect decision-makers to global and in-country experts in our network so they can dig deeper into research and think about how it might apply to their situations.<br/>You mentioned stunting. Can you give us some more examples of the kinds of topics you're studying?<br/>We started studying stunting about three years ago. The reason we chose stunting reduction as the lead topic is the multifactorial nature of the problem. It's not a single intervention, it's not a single sector that can drive the interventions.<br/>We then added child mortality reduction and community health worker platforms, and now we're researching a total of seven topics. On the nutrition side, we're expanding to maternal anemia outliers. We've also expanded to vaccine delivery, neonatal, and maternal mortality reduction. The most recent addition is health systems, which is just starting.<br/>Given the COVID-19 crisis, we also felt that the Exemplars methodology could reveal some of the positive outliers in epidemic preparedness and response. So, we did a sprint on that topic.<br/>Part of that project is looking at pandemic preparedness in general and past outliers, such as Uganda for the Ebola outbreak. But secondly and more relevant to our current crisis is if there are positive outliers when it comes to the COVID-19 response. (It&#8217;s too early to call any country a true &#8220;Exemplar,&#8221; since the pandemic is still going on.)<br/>In this case, we highlighted Vietnam, South Korea and Germany. Germany, in terms of keeping the case fatality rate low. Vietnam, in terms of just sheer low numbers of cases. And South Korea, how they tightly contained it with rapid testing and innovative testing models. And we know that there are other countries&#8212;and states like Kerala in India&#8212;that appear to have effectively addressed COVID-19.<br/>You mentioned that the research goes back three years. How did this get started?<br/>Bill and Melinda often ask the program teams at the foundation, &#8220;Who are the positive outliers and what have they done differently?&#8221;<br/>I remember almost 10 years or so ago, I got a call about a trip that Bill and Melinda had taken to Zambia, where they saw the MACEPA malaria program. They came back and asked, \"How do we help Zambia&#8217;s neighbors know what MACEPA is so they can replicate its lessons?&#8221;<br/>Eventually, we decided to try to address this question systematically.<br/>Sign up for The Optimist newsletter<br/>Subscribe to The Optimist to get weekly updates on the latest in global health, gender equality, education, and more.<br/>Email Address<br/>SUBSCRIBE<br/>By submitting your email to subscribe, you agree to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's Privacy & Cookies Notice<br/>What is the research process like?<br/>One of the biggest things we wanted to avoid is an exercise where a group sitting in Seattle is commenting about Rwanda, Peru, Nepal, Bangladesh. So right from the outset, the key word has been partnerships.<br/>For every single topic, we have a research partner, an academic, or a group that is deeply immersed in the subject matter.<br/>In addition to the research partners, each of the topics has a technical advisory group, which includes experts from around the world. They play a key role in the country selection process. Once the countries are chosen, there's yet another level of partnership that kicks in, identifying local academic research partners or organizations who can be the eyes and ears on the ground.<br/>We try to fill any gaps with a community of in-country experts who have had direct experience with the policies and programs we&#8217;re studying.<br/>Exemplars is not a single organization. It's a plethora of partners with the common goal of getting the most rigorous and objective analysis of a country's progress.<br/>Imagine the initiative five years in the future. What does Exemplars in Global Health look like? And how does it fit into the work of global health and development?<br/>Five years or so from now, I hope we are not pushing for this content to be adopted. I hope there is a pull from the community, including funding agencies, in-country decision makers, or implementation partners. I hope they want to use this content and actually co-create some of the content with us.<br/>True success for the program would be when the concept of Exemplars is just part of any decision-making process in the field. We don't have to ask the question, &#8220;Have we studied the Exemplars?&#8221; It&#8217;s just the norm."},{"id":90,"title":"Aspen Strategy Group","group":"Organization","image":"img/placeholder.png","value":1,"notes":""},{"id":91,"title":"Developing Countries Vaccine Manufactures Network (DCVMN)","group":"Organization","image":"img/Developing_Countries_Vaccine_Manufactures_Network_(DCVMN).png","value":1,"notes":"<br/>About DCVMN<br/>Mission and Vision<br/>Our values and principles<br/>Executive Committee<br/>Donors&#8217; Advisory Committee<br/>DCVMN Secretariat<br/>YouTube Video channel<br/>Privacy Policy<br/>About DCVMN<br/>The Developing Countries Vaccine Manufactures Network (DCVMN) was established in the year 2000, sharing the vision of protecting all people against known and emerging infectious diseases, with the mission of increasing the quality and availability of vaccines affordable to all.

The need to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal to end preventable maternal, newborn and child deaths by 2030 is urgent. We have just 12 years to finish the job and we know what needs to be done.<br/>We must fill a significant financing gap so that women&#8217;s, children&#8217;s, and adolescents&#8217; health and nutrition is prioritized and funded. The Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents (GFF) is helping governments in low- and lower-middle income countries transform how they prioritize and finance the health and nutrition of their people.<br/>The solutions lie with country leadership. With the right backing, governments in low and lower-middle income countries are significantly increasing investment in health and nutrition &#8211; transforming the lives of millions and greatly improving their country&#8217;s ability to thrive in the global economy.<br/>The GFF  was launched at the Financing for Development Conference in Addis Ababa in July 2015 as part of a global conversation about how to finance the SDGs, which requires a shift from thinking about billions of dollars to recognizing that we need trillions to achieve the ambitious targets that we have agreed upon. This shift is only possible through new approaches to financing that recognize that countries themselves are the engines of progress and that the role of external assistance is to support countries both to get more results from the existing resources and to increase the total volume of financing.<br/>Our job at the GFF is to help countries along the road. We empower governments to bring partners around the table to agree on a clear set of priorities and a country-led plan. Focusing on women, children and adolescents, countries invest in high-impact but historically under-funded areas such as sexual and reproductive health and rights, newborn survival, adolescent health, nutrition &#8211; and in the health systems needed to deliver at scale and sustain impact.<br/>The GFF Trust Fund acts as a catalyst for financing, with countries using modest GFF Trust Fund grants to significantly increase their domestic resources alongside the World Bank&#8217;s IDA and IBRD financing, aligned external financing, and private sector resources. Each relatively small external investment is multiplied by countries&#8217; own commitments &#8211; generating a large return on investment, contributing to lives saved and improved.<br/>We also support governments to ensure there is a strong system in place to track progress, learn, course-correct and continually improve.<br/>This is a powerful and ground-breaking approach that delivers far more than the sum of its parts. It is saving and transforming lives, and in the long-term also enabling countries to progress and flourish, with the right systems and capabilities for a strong, healthier and more prosperous future.<br/>The response so far has been profound and demand is high. In November 2018, world leaders pledged US$1 billion to help the GFF partnership on the pathway toward expanding to as many as 50 countries with the greatest health and nutrition needs.<br/>This is an historic opportunity to make progress towards universal health coverage by putting women, children and adolescents first.

Other topics of interest to the foundation include social and economic factors that can impact health, including quality of housing, violence, poverty, and access to fresh food.&#91;4&#93;<br/>Contents<br/>1&#9;History<br/>2&#9;Leadership<br/>3&#9;Grantmaking areas<br/>4&#9;References<br/>5&#9;External links<br/>History<br/>Robert Wood Johnson II built the family firm of Johnson & Johnson into the world's largest health products maker. He died in 1968. He established the foundation at his death with 10,204,377 shares of the company's stock.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;<br/>Leadership<br/>The foundation is currently headed by Richard E. Besser, who was named president and CEO in April 2017.&#91;7&#93; Besser succeeded Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, the foundation's president between 2002 and 2017. Lavizzo-Mourey worked to advance its vision of building a Culture of Health,&#91;8&#93; including spearheading efforts to reverse the national childhood obesity epidemic. The foundation committed $1 billion toward eradicating this health problem,&#91;9&#93; dedicating $500 million to the mission in 2007 and another $500 million in 2015.<br/>From 1990 to 2002, Steve Schroeder led the foundation.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>Grantmaking areas<br/>These interest areas include:<br/>Childhood Obesity: Backing projects that help reverse the childhood obesity epidemic by improving access to affordable, healthy food and providing more opportunities for children to play and exercise in their schools and communities. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's grants are focused on driving public policy initiatives and changing community environments. These include programs that encourage supermarkets to return to low-income communities and that improve nutrition, physical activity, and staff wellness in schools nationwide. The foundation partnered with The Food Trust, a non-profit in Philadelphia that helps make fresh, affordable food accessible to the underprivileged and educates children about healthy eating.<br/>Healthy Communities: Supporting initiatives that are helping to change conditions in local communities so that residents can reach their greatest health potential. The foundation's grants are focused in investments in housing, transportation, parks and open spaces, disease prevention, life expectancy, and the social, economic, and environmental factors that shape health.<br/>Health Insurance Coverage: Supporting policies and initiatives that expand health care coverage and increase enrollment in programs so that anyone in the U.S. can have affordable health care coverage.<br/>Health Care Cost, Quality, and Value: Promoting efforts to make high quality care available cost effectively. The foundation funds projects that study the relationships between the cost of care and results, develop ways to cut waste in the health care system, and advance research into how people's health is affected by factors such as education, transportation, income, clean air, and public or business policies. For example, in 2009, the foundation donated $2 million to Health Leads, a national health care organization that works with doctors in participating clinics to \"prescribe\" food, fuel assistance, housing vouchers, or other resources for their patients the same way they might prescribe medication.&#91;10&#93;<br/>Leadership for Better Health: Supporting projects that help health professionals develop leadership skills, encourage networking between different disciplines, and increase the diversity of people working in health care.<br/>Pioneer Portfolio: Making grants to promote approaches to entrenched problems, identify emerging health issues, and build new models for providing care. For example, the foundation gave nearly $5 million to Project ECHO, based at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. ECHO uses online videoconferencing to link primary-care doctors, nurses, and physicians' assistants with specialists to train them to treat and help manage complex conditions, such as hepatitis C and opiate addiction.&#91;11&#93;<br/><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wood_Johnson_Foundation\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wood_Johnson_Foundation</a><br/>"},{"id":99,"title":"Life Science Companies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: Commitments to Expanded Global Access for COVID-19 Diagnostics, Therapeutics, and Vaccines","group":"Gang","image":"img/BMGF_-_Bill_&_Melinda_Gates_Foundation.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://www.novartis.com/sites/www.novartis.com/files/covid-19-global-access-communique.pdf\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.novartis.com/sites/www.novartis.com/files/covid-19-global-access-communique.pdf</a><br/>"},{"id":100,"title":"Chatham House","group":"Organization","image":"img/Chatham_House.png","value":1,"notes":"Chatham House, also known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs, is an independent policy institute headquartered in London.

He has held key positions in the United Nations and World Health Organization involving AIDS research and management. He has also served as a professor at several universities worldwide.

Piot is the oldest of two brothers and a sister.&#91;1&#93;<br/>After beginning in the school of engineering and physics at Ghent University studying physics, Piot changed to medicine. During medical school, Piot received a diploma in tropical medicine from the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp in Antwerp. In 1974, he received a M.D. from Ghent University.&#91;1&#93;<br/>In 1980, Piot received a PhD in clinical microbiology from the University of Antwerp.&#91;1&#93;&#91;3&#93;<br/>Career<br/>In 1976, while working at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Piot was part of a team that observed a Marburg-like virus in a sample of blood taken from a sick nun working in Zaire.&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93; Piot and his colleagues subsequently traveled to Zaire as part of an International Commission set up by the Government of Zaire to help quell the outbreak.&#91;1&#93; The International Commission made key discoveries into how the virus spread, and traveled from village to village, spreading information and putting the ill and those who had come into contact with them into quarantine. The epidemic was already waning when the International Commission arrived, thanks to measures taken by local and national authorities, and it finally stopped in three months, after it had killed almost 300 people.&#91;6&#93; The events were dramatised by Mike Walker on BBC Radio 4 in December 2014 in a production by David Morley. Piot narrated the programme.&#91;7&#93;<br/>Piot has received the majority of the credit for discovering Ebola, since in 1976, it was claimed he was the one to receive blood samples while working in a lab at the Institute for Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium.&#91;3&#93; The samples were once claimed to be originally sent by Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, a Congolese doctor who obtained the blood samples from those sickened with a mysterious disease in then-Zaire, later discovered to be Ebola. In 2012, Piot published a memoir entitled No Time to Lose which chronicles his professional work, including the discovery of the Ebolavirus; he mentions Muyembe in passing rather than as a co-discoverer.&#91;8&#93; In a 2016 Journal of Infectious Disease article, co-signed by most of the actors from that first outbreak, including Peter Piot and Jean-Jacques Muyembe, the claims by both Piot and Muyembe to have played a significant role in the early discovery of Ebola have been refuted.&#91;9&#93; Piot stated in 2019 that \"my book was not an attempt to write the history of Ebola, but more my personal experience\".&#91;10&#93;<br/>In the 1980s, Piot participated in a series of collaborative projects in Burundi, C&#244;te d'Ivoire, Kenya, Tanzania, and Zaire. Project SIDA in Kinshasa, Zaire was the first international project on AIDS in Africa and is widely acknowledged as having provided the foundations of science's understanding of HIV infection in Africa. He was a professor of microbiology, and of public health at the Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine, in Antwerp, and at the University of Nairobi, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, the Lausanne, and a visiting professor at the London School of Economics. He was also a senior fellow at the University of Washington in Seattle, a scholar in residence at the Ford Foundation, and a senior fellow at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.&#91;3&#93;<br/>From 1991 to 1994, Piot was president of the International AIDS Society. In 1992, he became assistant director of the World Health Organization's Global Programme on HIV/AIDS. On 12 December 1994, he was appointed executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and Assistant-Secretary-General of the United Nations.&#91;11&#93;<br/>From 2009 to 2010, Piot served as director of the Institute for Global Health at Imperial College London.&#91;3&#93;<br/>London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine<br/>In October 2010, Piot became the director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.&#91;12&#93;<br/>In addition to his work at LSHTM, Piot is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States and the Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium, a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London, UK and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. In 2011, Amy Gutmann appointed him to serve on the International Research Panel at the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues.<br/>In 2014, in the face of an unprecedented Ebola epidemic in western Africa, Piot and other scientists called for the emergency release of the experimental ZMapp vaccine for use on humans before it had undergone clinical testing on humans.&#91;13&#93; That year, he was appointed by Director General Margaret Chan to the World Health Organization's Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response, co-chaired by Sam Zaramba and David L. Heymann.&#91;14&#93; He also chaired an independent panel convened by Harvard Global Health Institute and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine into the national and international response to the epidemic, which sharply criticised the response of the WHO and put forward ten recommendations for the body's reorganisation.&#91;15&#93; In February 2020, he criticised the delay in declaring the 2019&#8211;20 novel coronavirus outbreak focused on Hubei, China, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and advocated a five-point scale for outbreaks, rather the current binary (emergency/no emergency) system.&#91;16&#93;<br/>In 2020, Piot was appointed to the European Commission&#8217;s advisory panel on COVID-19, co-chaired by Ursula von der Leyen and Stella Kyriakides.&#91;17&#93; In the preparations for the Global Health Summit hosted by the European Commission and the G20 in May 2021, Piot co-chaired the event's High Level Scientific Panel.&#91;18&#93;<br/>Personal life<br/>In May 2020, Piot disclosed that he had had COVID-19.&#91;19&#93;<br/>Piot is fluent in English, French, and Dutch.&#91;3&#93;<br/>Other activities<br/>Centre for International Health Protection (ZIG), Robert Koch Institute (RKI), member of the scientific advisory board (since 2020)&#91;20&#93;<br/>Exemplars in Global Health, member of the senior advisory board (since 2020)&#91;21&#93;<br/>Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), member of the board (since 2018)&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93;<br/>The Lancet Public Health, member of the editorial advisory board (since 2016)&#91;24&#93;<br/>Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI), chair of the board of directors (since 2017)&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93;<br/>UK Collaborative on Development Research (UKCDR), chair of the Strategic Coherence of ODA-funded Research (since 2017)&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93;<br/>Africa Research Excellence Fund (AREF), member of the advisory panel (since 2015)&#91;29&#93;<br/>Novartis Foundation, member of the board of trustees (since 2015)&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93;<br/>Antwerp Management School, member of the international advisory board&#91;32&#93;<br/>Centre Virchow-Villerm&#233;, member of the international advisory board&#91;33&#93;<br/>Global Health Corps, member of the board of advisors&#91;34&#93;<br/>Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT), member of the board of directors&#91;35&#93;<br/>The Lancet, member of the international advisory board&#91;36&#93;<br/>University of Washington, External Member of the advisory board at the Department of Global Health&#91;37&#93;<br/>World Health Summit, member of the council&#91;38&#93;<br/>Awards<br/>2003: Calderone Prize&#91;39&#93;<br/>2004: Vlerick Award<br/>2008: America-Flanders Award&#91;40&#93;<br/>2013: Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize&#91;41&#93;<br/>2013: Prince Mahidol Award&#91;42&#93;<br/>2015: Prix International de l&#8217;INSERM&#91;43&#93;<br/>2015: Canada Gairdner Global Health Award&#91;44&#93;<br/>2016: Manson Medal&#91;45&#93;<br/>2018: Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.&#91;46&#93;"},{"id":106,"title":"Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science EV","group":"Organization","image":"img/placeholder.png","value":1,"notes":"Portr&#228;t<br/>Das Max-Planck-Institut f&#252;r Infektionsbiologie wurde 1992 gegr&#252;ndet.

This academic band, including Wilson's closest adviser and long-time friend \"Colonel\" Edward M. House, as well as Walter Lippmann, met to assemble the strategy for the postwar world.&#91;2&#93;:13&#8211;14 The team produced more than 2,000 documents detailing and analyzing the political, economic, and social facts globally that would be helpful for Wilson in the peace talks. Their reports formed the basis for the Fourteen Points, which outlined Wilson's strategy for peace after war's end. These scholars then traveled to the Paris Peace Conference 1919 and participated in the discussions there.&#91;3&#93;:1&#8211;5<br/>As a result of discussions at the Peace Conference, a small group of British and American diplomats and scholars met on May 30, 1919 at the Hotel Majestic in Paris and decided to create an Anglo-American organization called \"The Institute of International Affairs\", which would have offices in London and New York.&#91;2&#93;:12&#91;3&#93;:5 Ultimately, the British and American delegates formed separate institutes, with the British developing the Royal Institute of International Affairs or Chatham House in London. Due to the isolationist views prevalent in American society at the time, the scholars had difficulty gaining traction with their plan, and turned their focus instead to a set of discreet meetings which had been taking place since June 1918 in New York City, under the name \"Council on Foreign Relations\". The meetings were headed by the corporate lawyer Elihu Root, who had served as Secretary of State under President Theodore Roosevelt, and attended by 108 \"high-ranking officers of banking, manufacturing, trading and finance companies, together with many lawyers\". The members were proponents of Wilson's internationalism, but were particularly concerned about \"the effect that the war and the treaty of peace might have on postwar business\".&#91;3&#93;:6&#8211;7 The scholars from the inquiry saw an opportunity to create an organization that brought diplomats, high-level government officials, and academics together with lawyers, bankers, and industrialists to engineer government policy. On July 29, 1921, they filed a certification of incorporation, officially forming the Council on Foreign Relations.&#91;3&#93;:8&#8211;9<br/>In 1922, Edwin F. Gay, former dean of the Harvard Business School and director of the Shipping Board during the war, spearheaded the Council's efforts to begin publication of a magazine that would be the \"authoritative\" source on foreign policy. He gathered US$125,000 (equivalent to $1,909,294 in 2019) from the wealthy members on the council, as well as by sending letters soliciting funds to \"the thousand richest Americans\". Using these funds, the first issue of Foreign Affairs was published in September 1922, and within a few years had gained a reputation as the \"most authoritative American review dealing with international relations\".&#91;2&#93;:17&#8211;18<br/>In the late 1930s, the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation began contributing large amounts of money to the Council.&#91;4&#93; In 1938, they created various Committees on Foreign Relations, which later became governed by the American Committees on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C., throughout the country, funded by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation. Influential men were to be chosen in a number of cities, and would then be brought together for discussions in their own communities as well as participating in an annual conference in New York. These local committees served to influence local leaders and shape public opinion to build support for the Council's policies, while also acting as \"useful listening posts\" through which the Council and U.S. government could \"sense the mood of the country\".&#91;2&#93;:30&#8211;31<br/>Beginning in 1939, and lasting for five years, the Council achieved much greater prominence within the government and the State Department, when it established the strictly confidential War and Peace Studies, funded entirely by the Rockefeller Foundation.&#91;3&#93;:23 The secrecy surrounding this group was such that the Council members who were not involved in its deliberations were completely unaware of the study group's existence.&#91;3&#93;:26 It was divided into four functional topic groups: economic and financial; security and armaments; territorial; and political. The security and armaments group was headed by Allen Welsh Dulles, who later became a pivotal figure in the CIA's predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). CFR ultimately produced 682 memoranda for the State Department, which were marked classified and circulated among the appropriate government departments.&#91;3&#93;:23&#8211;26<br/>Cold War era, 1945 to 1979<br/>David Rockefeller (1915&#8211;2017), joined the Council in 1941 and was appointed as a director in 1949<br/>A critical study found that of 502 government officials surveyed from 1945 to 1972, more than half were members of the Council.&#91;3&#93;:48 During the Eisenhower administration 40% of the top U.S. foreign policy officials were CFR members (Eisenhower himself had been a council member); under Truman, 42% of the top posts were filled by council members. During the Kennedy administration, this number rose to 51%, and peaked at 57% under the Johnson administration.&#91;2&#93;:62&#8211;64<br/>In an anonymous piece called \"The Sources of Soviet Conduct\" that appeared in Foreign Affairs in 1947, CFR study group member George Kennan coined the term \"containment\". The essay would prove to be highly influential in US foreign policy for seven upcoming presidential administrations. Forty years later, Kennan explained that he had never suspected the Russians of any desire to launch an attack on America; he thought that it was obvious enough and he did not need to explain it in his essay. William Bundy credited CFR's study groups with helping to lay the framework of thinking that led to the Marshall Plan and NATO. Due to new interest in the group, membership grew towards 1,000.&#91;3&#93;:35&#8211;39<br/>CFR Headquarters, located in the former Harold Pratt House in New York City<br/>Dwight D. Eisenhower chaired a CFR study group while he served as President of Columbia University. One member later said, \"whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics, he has learned at the study group meetings.\"&#91;3&#93;:35&#8211;44 The CFR study group devised an expanded study group called \"Americans for Eisenhower\" to increase his chances for the presidency. Eisenhower would later draw many Cabinet members from CFR ranks and become a CFR member himself. His primary CFR appointment was Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. Dulles gave a public address at the Harold Pratt House in New York City in which he announced a new direction for Eisenhower's foreign policy: \"There is no local defense which alone will contain the mighty land power of the communist world. Local defenses must be reinforced by the further deterrent of massive retaliatory power.\" After this speech, the council convened a session on \"Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy\" and chose Henry Kissinger to head it. Kissinger spent the following academic year working on the project at Council headquarters. The book of the same name that he published from his research in 1957 gave him national recognition, topping the national bestseller lists.&#91;3&#93;:39&#8211;41<br/>On November 24, 1953, a study group heard a report from political scientist William Henderson regarding the ongoing conflict between France and Vietnamese Communist leader Ho Chi Minh's Viet Minh forces, a struggle that would later become known as the First Indochina War. Henderson argued that Ho's cause was primarily nationalist in nature and that Marxism had \"little to do with the current revolution.\" Further, the report said, the United States could work with Ho to guide his movement away from Communism. State Department officials, however, expressed skepticism about direct American intervention in Vietnam and the idea was tabled. Over the next twenty years, the United States would find itself allied with anti-Communist South Vietnam and against Ho and his supporters in the Vietnam War.&#91;3&#93;:40, 49&#8211;67<br/>The Council served as a \"breeding ground\" for important American policies such as mutual deterrence, arms control, and nuclear non-proliferation.&#91;3&#93;:40&#8211;42<br/>In 1962 the group began a program of bringing select Air Force officers to the Harold Pratt House to study alongside its scholars. The Army, Navy and Marine Corps requested they start similar programs for their own officers.&#91;3&#93;:46<br/>A four-year-long study of relations between America and China was conducted by the Council between 1964 and 1968. One study published in 1966 concluded that American citizens were more open to talks with China than their elected leaders. Henry Kissinger had continued to publish in Foreign Affairs and was appointed by President Nixon to serve as National Security Adviser in 1969. In 1971, he embarked on a secret trip to Beijing to broach talks with Chinese leaders. Richard Nixon went to China in 1972, and diplomatic relations were completely normalized by President Carter's Secretary of State, another Council member, Cyrus Vance.&#91;3&#93;:42&#8211;44<br/>Vietnam created a rift within the organization. When Hamilton Fish Armstrong announced in 1970 that he would be leaving the helm of Foreign Affairs after 45 years, new chairman David Rockefeller approached a family friend, William Bundy, to take over the position. Anti-war advocates within the Council rose in protest against this appointment, claiming that Bundy's hawkish record in the State and Defense Departments and the CIA precluded him from taking over an independent journal. Some considered Bundy a war criminal for his prior actions.&#91;3&#93;:50&#8211;51<br/>In November 1979, while chairman of CFR, David Rockefeller became embroiled in an international incident when he and Henry Kissinger, along with John J. McCloy and Rockefeller aides, persuaded President Jimmy Carter through the State Department to admit the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, into the US for hospital treatment for lymphoma. This action directly precipitated what is known as the Iran hostage crisis and placed Rockefeller under intense media scrutiny (particularly from The New York Times) for the first time in his public life.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;<br/>In his book White House Diary, Carter wrote of the affair, \"April 9 &#91;1979&#93; David Rockefeller came in, apparently to induce me to let the shah come to the United States. Rockefeller, Kissinger, and Brzezinski seem to be adopting this as a joint project\".&#91;7&#93;<br/>Current status<br/>President Richard N.

This academic band, including Wilson's closest adviser and long-time friend \"Colonel\" Edward M. House, as well as Walter Lippmann, met to assemble the strategy for the postwar world.&#91;2&#93;:13&#8211;14 The team produced more than 2,000 documents detailing and analyzing the political, economic, and social facts globally that would be helpful for Wilson in the peace talks. Their reports formed the basis for the Fourteen Points, which outlined Wilson's strategy for peace after war's end. These scholars then traveled to the Paris Peace Conference 1919 and participated in the discussions there.&#91;3&#93;:1&#8211;5<br/>As a result of discussions at the Peace Conference, a small group of British and American diplomats and scholars met on May 30, 1919 at the Hotel Majestic in Paris and decided to create an Anglo-American organization called \"The Institute of International Affairs\", which would have offices in London and New York.&#91;2&#93;:12&#91;3&#93;:5 Ultimately, the British and American delegates formed separate institutes, with the British developing the Royal Institute of International Affairs or Chatham House in London. Due to the isolationist views prevalent in American society at the time, the scholars had difficulty gaining traction with their plan, and turned their focus instead to a set of discreet meetings which had been taking place since June 1918 in New York City, under the name \"Council on Foreign Relations\". The meetings were headed by the corporate lawyer Elihu Root, who had served as Secretary of State under President Theodore Roosevelt, and attended by 108 \"high-ranking officers of banking, manufacturing, trading and finance companies, together with many lawyers\". The members were proponents of Wilson's internationalism, but were particularly concerned about \"the effect that the war and the treaty of peace might have on postwar business\".&#91;3&#93;:6&#8211;7 The scholars from the inquiry saw an opportunity to create an organization that brought diplomats, high-level government officials, and academics together with lawyers, bankers, and industrialists to engineer government policy. On July 29, 1921, they filed a certification of incorporation, officially forming the Council on Foreign Relations.&#91;3&#93;:8&#8211;9<br/>In 1922, Edwin F. Gay, former dean of the Harvard Business School and director of the Shipping Board during the war, spearheaded the Council's efforts to begin publication of a magazine that would be the \"authoritative\" source on foreign policy. He gathered US$125,000 (equivalent to $1,909,294 in 2019) from the wealthy members on the council, as well as by sending letters soliciting funds to \"the thousand richest Americans\". Using these funds, the first issue of Foreign Affairs was published in September 1922, and within a few years had gained a reputation as the \"most authoritative American review dealing with international relations\".&#91;2&#93;:17&#8211;18<br/>In the late 1930s, the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation began contributing large amounts of money to the Council.&#91;4&#93; In 1938, they created various Committees on Foreign Relations, which later became governed by the American Committees on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C., throughout the country, funded by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation. Influential men were to be chosen in a number of cities, and would then be brought together for discussions in their own communities as well as participating in an annual conference in New York. These local committees served to influence local leaders and shape public opinion to build support for the Council's policies, while also acting as \"useful listening posts\" through which the Council and U.S. government could \"sense the mood of the country\".&#91;2&#93;:30&#8211;31<br/>Beginning in 1939, and lasting for five years, the Council achieved much greater prominence within the government and the State Department, when it established the strictly confidential War and Peace Studies, funded entirely by the Rockefeller Foundation.&#91;3&#93;:23 The secrecy surrounding this group was such that the Council members who were not involved in its deliberations were completely unaware of the study group's existence.&#91;3&#93;:26 It was divided into four functional topic groups: economic and financial; security and armaments; territorial; and political. The security and armaments group was headed by Allen Welsh Dulles, who later became a pivotal figure in the CIA's predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). CFR ultimately produced 682 memoranda for the State Department, which were marked classified and circulated among the appropriate government departments.&#91;3&#93;:23&#8211;26<br/>Cold War era, 1945 to 1979<br/>David Rockefeller (1915&#8211;2017), joined the Council in 1941 and was appointed as a director in 1949<br/>A critical study found that of 502 government officials surveyed from 1945 to 1972, more than half were members of the Council.&#91;3&#93;:48 During the Eisenhower administration 40% of the top U.S. foreign policy officials were CFR members (Eisenhower himself had been a council member); under Truman, 42% of the top posts were filled by council members. During the Kennedy administration, this number rose to 51%, and peaked at 57% under the Johnson administration.&#91;2&#93;:62&#8211;64<br/>In an anonymous piece called \"The Sources of Soviet Conduct\" that appeared in Foreign Affairs in 1947, CFR study group member George Kennan coined the term \"containment\". The essay would prove to be highly influential in US foreign policy for seven upcoming presidential administrations. Forty years later, Kennan explained that he had never suspected the Russians of any desire to launch an attack on America; he thought that it was obvious enough and he did not need to explain it in his essay. William Bundy credited CFR's study groups with helping to lay the framework of thinking that led to the Marshall Plan and NATO. Due to new interest in the group, membership grew towards 1,000.&#91;3&#93;:35&#8211;39<br/>CFR Headquarters, located in the former Harold Pratt House in New York City<br/>Dwight D. Eisenhower chaired a CFR study group while he served as President of Columbia University. One member later said, \"whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics, he has learned at the study group meetings.\"&#91;3&#93;:35&#8211;44 The CFR study group devised an expanded study group called \"Americans for Eisenhower\" to increase his chances for the presidency. Eisenhower would later draw many Cabinet members from CFR ranks and become a CFR member himself. His primary CFR appointment was Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. Dulles gave a public address at the Harold Pratt House in New York City in which he announced a new direction for Eisenhower's foreign policy: \"There is no local defense which alone will contain the mighty land power of the communist world. Local defenses must be reinforced by the further deterrent of massive retaliatory power.\" After this speech, the council convened a session on \"Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy\" and chose Henry Kissinger to head it. Kissinger spent the following academic year working on the project at Council headquarters. The book of the same name that he published from his research in 1957 gave him national recognition, topping the national bestseller lists.&#91;3&#93;:39&#8211;41<br/>On November 24, 1953, a study group heard a report from political scientist William Henderson regarding the ongoing conflict between France and Vietnamese Communist leader Ho Chi Minh's Viet Minh forces, a struggle that would later become known as the First Indochina War. Henderson argued that Ho's cause was primarily nationalist in nature and that Marxism had \"little to do with the current revolution.\" Further, the report said, the United States could work with Ho to guide his movement away from Communism. State Department officials, however, expressed skepticism about direct American intervention in Vietnam and the idea was tabled. Over the next twenty years, the United States would find itself allied with anti-Communist South Vietnam and against Ho and his supporters in the Vietnam War.&#91;3&#93;:40, 49&#8211;67<br/>The Council served as a \"breeding ground\" for important American policies such as mutual deterrence, arms control, and nuclear non-proliferation.&#91;3&#93;:40&#8211;42<br/>In 1962 the group began a program of bringing select Air Force officers to the Harold Pratt House to study alongside its scholars. The Army, Navy and Marine Corps requested they start similar programs for their own officers.&#91;3&#93;:46<br/>A four-year-long study of relations between America and China was conducted by the Council between 1964 and 1968. One study published in 1966 concluded that American citizens were more open to talks with China than their elected leaders. Henry Kissinger had continued to publish in Foreign Affairs and was appointed by President Nixon to serve as National Security Adviser in 1969. In 1971, he embarked on a secret trip to Beijing to broach talks with Chinese leaders. Richard Nixon went to China in 1972, and diplomatic relations were completely normalized by President Carter's Secretary of State, another Council member, Cyrus Vance.&#91;3&#93;:42&#8211;44<br/>Vietnam created a rift within the organization. When Hamilton Fish Armstrong announced in 1970 that he would be leaving the helm of Foreign Affairs after 45 years, new chairman David Rockefeller approached a family friend, William Bundy, to take over the position. Anti-war advocates within the Council rose in protest against this appointment, claiming that Bundy's hawkish record in the State and Defense Departments and the CIA precluded him from taking over an independent journal. Some considered Bundy a war criminal for his prior actions.&#91;3&#93;:50&#8211;51<br/>In November 1979, while chairman of CFR, David Rockefeller became embroiled in an international incident when he and Henry Kissinger, along with John J. McCloy and Rockefeller aides, persuaded President Jimmy Carter through the State Department to admit the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, into the US for hospital treatment for lymphoma. This action directly precipitated what is known as the Iran hostage crisis and placed Rockefeller under intense media scrutiny (particularly from The New York Times) for the first time in his public life.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;<br/>In his book White House Diary, Carter wrote of the affair, \"April 9 &#91;1979&#93; David Rockefeller came in, apparently to induce me to let the shah come to the United States. Rockefeller, Kissinger, and Brzezinski seem to be adopting this as a joint project\".&#91;7&#93;<br/>Current status<br/>President Richard N. Haass (2009, age 57).<br/>Madeleine Albright with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.<br/>Richard Haass with Hillary Clinton.<br/>Membership<br/>Main article: Members of the Council on Foreign Relations<br/>The CFR has two types of membership: life membership; and term membership, which lasts for 5 years and is available only to those between the ages of 30 and 36. Only U.S. citizens (native born or naturalized) and permanent residents who have applied for U.S. citizenship are eligible. A candidate for life membership must be nominated in writing by one Council member and seconded by a minimum of three others. Visiting fellows are prohibited from applying for membership until they have completed their fellowship tenure.&#91;8&#93;<br/>Corporate membership (250 in total) is divided into \"Associates\", \"Affiliates\", \"President's Circle\", and \"Founders\". All corporate executive members have opportunities to hear speakers, including foreign heads of state, chairmen and CEOs of multinational corporations, and U.S. officials and Congressmen. President and premium members are also entitled to attend small, private dinners or receptions with senior American officials and world leaders.&#91;9&#93;<br/><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations</a><br/>"},{"id":109,"title":"World Vision","group":"Organization","image":"img/World_Vision.png","value":1,"notes":"World Vision International<br/>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>Jump to navigationJump to search<br/>For the unrelated television production company of the same name, see Worldvision Enterprises.<br/>World Vision International<br/>World Vision logo 2017.png<br/>Founded&#9;1950&#91;1&#93;<br/>Founder&#9;Rev.

It became the organizational backbone of the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, collected and published data about \"unreached people\" and also published the \"Mission Handbook: North American Protestant Ministries Overseas\".&#91;12&#93;<br/>During the 1970s, World Vision began training families to build small farms by teaching agricultural skills aiming to make lasting effects in the communities they were helping by promoting self-reliance&#91;13&#93; The organization also began installing water pumps for clean water in communities which caused infant mortality rates to drop. Volunteers now use the fresh water to teach communities gardening and irrigation and promote good health.&#91;13&#93;<br/>In order to restructure, the organization World Vision International was founded in 1977 by Walter Stanley Mooneyham the then president of World Vision.&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93;<br/>In 1979, it co-founded with the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability.&#91;16&#93;<br/>During the 1990s, World Vision International began focusing on the needs of children who had been orphaned in Uganda, Romania, and Somalia in response to AIDS, neglect, and civil war, respectively. World Vision began working with communities, health providers, faith-based organisations and people living with HIV and AIDS to encourage an end to stigmatisation, better understanding of HIV prevention and community care for those living with AIDS, and orphans left behind by the pandemic. They also joined the United Nations peacekeeping efforts to help those affected by civil war. World Vision also started to openly promote the international ban on land mines.&#91;13&#93; In 1994 World Vision US moved to Washington State.&#91;17&#93;<br/>According to Forbes magazine, as of December 2014, World Vision is the 11th largest charity in the United States with total revenue of over 981 million dollars.&#91;18&#93;<br/>In 2020, it worked in more than 90 countries and had 37,000 employees.&#91;19&#93;<br/>Organizational structure<br/>World Vision Partnership now operates as a federation of interdependent national offices governed by the same agreement but with three different levels of central control.<br/>National Offices- under strong central control by World Vision International, registered in the host country as a branch of the main organization.<br/>Intermediate Stage National Offices with a separate board of directors<br/>Interdependently National Registered Offices- autonomous in internal decision but are expected to coordinate with World Vision International and are bound to the Covenant of Partnership.&#91;20&#93;<br/>The Covenant of Partnership is a document that all national members of the World Vision Partnership have to sign. According to this document all national offices have to accept policies and decisions established by the International Board and must not establish an office or program outside their own national borders without the consent of World Vision International and the host country. Except for direct project founding, all funds intended for outside their national borders have to be remitted through World Vision International. The financial planning and budget principles adopted by the International Board have to be accepted as well as an examination of the financial affairs of the national offices by Partnership representatives.&#91;21&#93;<br/>The president of World Vision International has a seat on all national offices with their own national board.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>The partnership offices &#8211; located in Geneva, Bangkok, Nairobi, Cyprus, Los Angeles, West Africa, South Africa, London, and San Jos&#233;, Costa Rica &#8211; coordinate operations of the organization and represent World Vision in the international arena. For making large scale decisions, the international organization considers opinions from each national office, whether in the developed or developing world.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>An international board of directors oversees the World Vision partnership. The full board meets twice a year to appoint senior officers, approve strategic plans and budgets, and determine international policy. The current chairperson of the international board is Donna Shepherd.&#91;22&#93; The international president is Andrew Morley.&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93;<br/>Beliefs<br/>World Vision's staff comes from a range of Christian denominations. Its staff includes followers of Protestantism, Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Around the world its staff includes followers of different religions or none.&#91;25&#93; Its staff participates in daily and weekly services. They stress that one can be a Christian in any culture. However, World Vision also respects other religions that it encounters, stating that \"to promote a secular approach to life would be an insult to them\".&#91;26&#93; Richard Stearns, president of World Vision US, stated that World Vision has a strict policy against proselytizing, which he describes as \"...using any kind of coercion or inducement to listen to a religious message before helping someone\".&#91;27&#93;<br/>The World Vision Partnership and all of its national members are committed to the concept of transformational development,&#91;28&#93; which is cast in a biblical framework and in which evangelization is an integral part of development work.&#91;29&#93;<br/>Programs<br/>WV relief effort in disaster affected areas<br/>Activities include: emergency relief, education, health care, economic development, and promotion of justice. &#91;30&#93; The organization has consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council and partnerships with UN agencies like UNICEF, WHO, UNHCR and ILO, and financial records reveal that it has funded evangelical activities all over the world.&#91;31&#93;<br/>Its approach to aid is to first help people and their communities recognize the resources that lie within them. With support from World Vision, it claims communities transform themselves by carrying out their own development projects in health care, agriculture production, water projects, education, micro-enterprise development, advocacy and other community programs.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>It also addresses factors that perpetuate poverty by what it describes as promoting justice. It supports community awareness of the collective ability to address unjust practices and begin working for change. It claims to speak out on issues such as child labor, debt relief for poor nations,&#91;32&#93; and the use of children as combatants in armed conflict. World Vision International has endorsed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It claims to foster opportunities to help reduce conflict levels and to contribute to the peaceful resolution of hostilities and reconciliation of disputes.&#91;33&#93;<br/>World Vision encourages public awareness about the needs of others, the causes of poverty, and the nature of compassionate response.&#91;34&#93; These efforts include collaboration with media and community participation in fundraising.&#91;35&#93; In areas of the world that are considered too dangerous for news organizations to send their crews, World Vision's own videographers supply newscasters with footage of events from these areas.&#91;36&#93; In its communications, the organization claims to uphold the dignity of children and families in presenting explanations of the causes and consequences of poverty, neglect, abuse and war.&#91;37&#93;<br/>The organization was one of the founding members of global IT nonprofit NetHope.&#91;38&#93; With more than 50 years of experience in India, World Vision India works in 24 states across the country through development that is community based, sustainable and transformational emergency response and disaster mitigation, advocacy initiatives that are grassroots based. World Vision India is a national NGO in partnership with a network of over 100 other entities within World Vision International. World Vision India is registered as a society under the Tamil Nadu Societies Act with its National Office based in Chennai. Governed by an autonomous Board of Directors, World Vision's programmes are facilitated by close to 1700 staff.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>In 2015, World Vision took part in operations to bring earthquake relief to Nepal.&#91;39&#93;<br/>Child sponsorship<br/>World Vision runs a child sponsorship program which aims to help needy children, families and communities access clean drinking water, sanitation, education, skills for future livelihood, nutrition, health care and participate in an age-appropriate in development processes. World Vision operates on the theory that by changing the lives of children, the child sponsorship program facilitates overall growth and development in the community, as it helps communities to build a better future through empowerment, education, income generation, and self-sufficiency.&#91;40&#93;&#91;failed verification&#93;<br/>Controversy<br/>After his resignation from the post of president, its founder Robert Pierce criticized the organization for its professionalization at the expense of its evangelical faith and founded Samaritan's Purse in 1970.&#91;41&#93;<br/>Accusations of misrepresentation<br/>World Vision uses the Sponsor a Child method of fundraising.&#91;42&#93;<br/>In a 2008 report on famine in Ethiopia, reporter Andrew Geoghegan, from Australian TV programme Foreign Correspondent, visited his 14-year-old sponsor child. The girl has \"been part of a World Vision program all her life\" yet says (in translated subtitle) \"Until recently, I didn't know I had a sponsor.\" And when asked about her knowledge of World Vision sponsorship says, \"Last time they gave me this jacket and a pen.\" Geoghegan was disconcerted to find that despite being \"told by World Vision that &#91;the girl&#93; was learning English at school, and was improving...she speaks no English at all\".&#91;43&#93;<br/>In response, World Vision stated that \"it unapologetically takes a community-based approach to development\", in which the money is not directly provided to the family of the sponsored child.&#91;44&#93; The organization argued that the \"direct benefit\" approach would result in jealousy among other community members without children and would not work.&#91;44&#93;<br/>Foreign Correspondent replied to World Vision concerning child sponsorship, showing contradictions between the organization's literature that creates the impression that donated money goes directly to the sponsor child and evidence of cases where supposedly sponsored children received little if any benefit.&#91;45&#93;<br/>Local corruption<br/>\"In February 2007...World Vision received an anonymous tip that lower level World Vision Liberia employees in key positions...were diverting food deliveries and building supplies for personal gain. World Vision immediately launched an investigation into the allegations, sending auditors to &#91;their&#93; field sites.&#91;46&#93; Through this extensive internal audit, World Vision uncovered the nature and extent of the alleged violations and furnished detailed documentation that assisted the U.S. Government's subsequent investigation.\"&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>Relationship with U.S. government<br/>Ian Buchanan, author of \"Armies Of God: A Study In Militant Christianity\", has claimed that World Vision is effectively an arm of the United States Department of State.&#91;47&#93;<br/>Same-sex marriage ban<br/>On March 24, 2014, the United States branch of World Vision announced that it would no longer ban employees from being in same-sex marriages.&#91;48&#93; Facing protests from donors and the larger evangelical community after the announcement, World Vision reversed the policy change two days later.&#91;49&#93;&#91;50&#93;<br/>Evangelism<br/>The political weekly Tehelka has cited World Vision India's involvement with AD2000 as proof of evangelism.&#91;51&#93; Radhakant Nayak, a leader of World Vision's local chapter in Orissa, was also accused by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of being involved in the murder of Swami Lakshmanananda.&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93; World Vision India condemned the murder and denied any involvement, pointing out its anti-proselytizing policy.&#91;54&#93; Valerie Tarico, a commentator on religious and social topics, points out that World Vision defines proselytism as \"Proselytism takes place whenever assistance is offered on condition that people must listen or respond to a message or as an inducement to leave one and join another part of the Christian church.\" which does not in general exclude evangelism. Furthermore, she mentions the phrase \"serving as a witness to the gospel of Jesus Christ\" as part of World Vision's description of its mission and identifies the word \"witness\" as an evangelical code word for seeking converts.&#91;55&#93;<br/>Israel and Palestine<br/>In 1982, after World Vision publicly criticized Israel actions in Palestinian refugee camps near Sidon and Tyre, it came under attack from conservative evangelicals and the government of Israel. In spite of this pressure, WV president Mooneyham presented to the eight hundred thousand readers of World Vision Magazine a report \"showing 255 bodies and ankle-deep body fluids left in a school basement by an Israeli bomb.\"&#91;56&#93; In this September issues of World Vision Magazine President Stanley Mooneyham was quoted describing Israeli actions with the behavior of Hitler's army, \"reminiscent of Warsaw.\"&#91;57&#93; In the same month Mooneyham was forced to resign when, according to former World Vision employee Ken Waters, his leadership style was criticized; he was replaced as President by Ted Engstrom.&#91;58&#93;<br/>In February 2012, based on information provided by the Shurat HaDin - Israel Law Center, World Vision Australia allegedly provided \"financial aid to a Gaza-based terrorist group\", the Union of Agricultural Work Committees (UAWC), which they also alleged is a \"front for terror group the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine\". WV had \"suspended its dealings\" with UAWC until the outcome of the investigation.&#91;59&#93;&#91;60&#93; WV resumed working with UAWC after AusAID and World Vision found the allegations were unfounded.&#91;61&#93; The Israel Law Center considers World Vision's response to be a whitewash and maintains that the allegations have not been refuted.&#91;62&#93;<br/>On June 15, 2016, Mohammad El Halabi, manager of World Vision in Gaza, was arrested at the Erez border crossing and charged by Israeli prosecutors with channeling its funds directly to Hamas, a listed terror organization.&#91;63&#93; A senior official with Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, stated that Halabi was recruited by the military wing of Hamas in 2004 and instructed to penetrate World Vision.&#91;63&#93;&#91;64&#93;&#91;65&#93; According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Halabi transferred cash to Hamas to help it in digging military tunnels and purchasing weapons.&#91;65&#93; Muhammad Mahmoud, Halabi's lawyer, told Haaretz that his client has nothing to do with Hamas and that the fact that the investigation had lasted 55 days proves that there is a problem with evidence.&#91;65&#93; Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency claims that about $48 million of World Vision resources were funneled to Hamas in just six years and another $80,000 was used for building a Hamas position in Beit Hanon and for paying salaries of Hamas members who fought against Israel in the 2014 war. World Vision confirmed that its funds are spent in accordance with legal requirements that contribute to peace and that the charity works closely with the UN and Red Cross.&#91;66&#93; The charity initially defended Halabi as a \"humanitarian\".&#91;67&#93;<br/>In August 2016, Israeli officials claimed that the World Vision organization was providing the military wing of Hamas with tens of millions of dollars in Gaza. World Vision has denounced these allegations which come amid Israeli campaigns against the non-governmental organizations that worked with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.&#91;68&#93;&#91;2&#93;<br/>The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade immediately suspended all funding of Palestinian programs by World Vision.&#91;69&#93; World Vision Australia chief executive, Tim Costello, accepted this move as being the correct thing to do pending a proper investigation of the allegations.&#91;70&#93;&#91;71&#93; A review of the Australian government came to the conclusion that no Australian taxpayer money was diverted to Hamas.&#91;72&#93;"},{"id":110,"title":"University of Birmingham","group":"EducationInstitution","image":"img/placeholder.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/</a>"},{"id":111,"title":"IVI - International Vaccine Institute","group":"Organization","image":"img/IVI_-_International_Vaccine_Institute.png","value":1,"notes":""},{"id":112,"title":"The Inclen Trust International","group":"Organization","image":"img/placeholder.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"http://inclentrust.org/inclen/introduction/\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">http://inclentrust.org/inclen/introduction/</a><br/>Who We Are<br/>The INCLEN Trust International is a &#8216;not for profit&#8217; research organization conducting collaborative, multi-disciplinary studies on high priority global health issues<br/>Clinical Epidemiology Units (CEU) and Clinical Epidemiology Research Training Centre (CERTC&#8217;s) located in 89 academic institutions in 34 countries are core functional units of INCLEN<br/>Globally, INCLEN network is grouped in to seven regional networks: LATINCLEN, CANUSACLEN, INCLENAFRICA, CHINACLEN, INDIACLEN, INCLENASIA and EUROMEDCLEN<br/>History<br/>In 1980, INCLEN was started as a project of Rockefeller Foundation with an overarching goal to promote Clinical Epidemiology as a bridge discipline between Clinical Medicine and Public Health<br/>In 1988, INCLEN Inc. was established as an independent, not for profit organization in Philadelphia, USA<br/>In 2000, the leadership shifted to Low and Middle Income Countries and The INCLEN Trust International was established.

This has been attested in January 2013 by the ranking of the Global Go To Think Tanks Report (of the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program (TTCSP)): For the fifth consecutive time, DIE has been selected as one of the Top Ten influential think tanks and research institutions in the field of development policy worldwide. The German Development Institute / Deutsches Institut f&#252;r Entwicklungspolitik (DIE) is one of only three European research institutes ranked in this Top Ten list. DIE improved its visibility in the international context in the current ranking on a wide scale, such as in the categories Top Think Tanks in Western Europe, Top Think Tanks &#8211; Worldwide and Best Government Affiliated Think Tanks. Once again, DIE belongs to the Top 20 institutions among the Think Tanks with the Most Innovative Policy Ideas/Proposals. Furthermore, DIE was evaluated in a number of categories for the first time, e.g., within the category Think Tanks with Outstanding Policy-Oriented Research Programs) or in the field of knowledge marketing (Think Tanks with the Best External Relations/Public Engagement Program). The Institute is based in the UN-City of Bonn. DIE builds bridges between theory and practice and works within international research networks. The key to DIE&#8217;s success is its institutional independence, which is guaranteed by the Institute&#8217;s founding statute.<br/>The German DIE is a non-profit company with limited liability. The Institute&#8217;s institutional independence is guaranteed by its founding statute. The shareholders are the Federal Republic of Germany and the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia.

DIE&#8217;s Postgraduate Training Programme is an integral component of the Research and Consulting process. The many years of experience of the Institute&#8217;s professional staff as well as the creative impulses generated by the future development experts and managers trained at the Institute serve to reinforce one another. The policy advice and consulting services DIE provides are bearing on the framework conditions of development policy, including issues concerned with world economic policy, foreign policy, and security policy.<br/>Training<br/>The Institute&#8217;s Postgraduate Training Programme is concentrated on courses dedicated to development-related themes and issues bound up with shaping the process of globalisation as well as with improving trainee communicative and social skills. The cornerstone of the Postgraduate Training Programme &#8211; field research carried out by small interdisciplinary groups in a developing country &#8211; serves to provide trainees with an opportunity to gain practical experience with what they have learned by participating in concrete consulting-oriented research projects. Once they have completed the Postgraduate Training Programme, the graduates find career opportunities with development organisations in Germany and abroad.<br/>In addition to the Postgraduate Training Programme, the German Development Institute / Deutsches Institut f&#252;r Entwicklungspolitik (DIE) offers Young Professionals from selected partner countries of Germany&#8217;s international cooperation the participation in the &#8220;Global Governance School&#8221;.

Shah also spent time at the London School of Economics where he earned a general course certificate in economics.&#91;7&#93; During the 2000 Gore-Lieberman Presidential Campaign, Shah was a health policy advisor and research associate. He also served as a member of Governor Ed Rendell's (D-PA) transition committee on health.&#91;8&#93;<br/>The Gates Foundation<br/>Shah joined the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2001, serving in a range of leadership roles including Director of Agricultural Development, Director of Strategic Opportunities, Deputy Director of Policy and Finance and Chief Economist. During his time at Gates, he led the launch of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, an alliance with the Rockefeller Foundation that focuses on addressing the specific environmental and agricultural needs of African farmers.&#91;9&#93;<br/>Shah was also responsible for developing the International Finance Facility for Immunization, which raised more than $5 billion for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). IFFI has been recognized as an example of the power of innovative financing for global development.&#91;10&#93;<br/>Obama administration<br/>United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)<br/>Shah was nominated by President Obama to serve as Chief Scientist and Undersecretary of Agriculture for Research, Education and Economics on April 17, 2009. He was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on May 12, 2009. Shah was responsible for management and oversight of the U.S. Government's Agricultural Research Service, Economic Research Service, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, National Agricultural Statistics Service. Shah also led the creation and launch of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to bring peer-reviewed scientific processes to agricultural research.&#91;11&#93;<br/>United States Agency for International Development (USAID)<br/>January 7, 2010: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the swearing-in ceremony of Shah as new USAID Coordinator, in Washington, DC.<br/>Shah was nominated to serve as the 16th Administrator of USAID on November 10, 2009 and confirmed by the United States Senate unanimously on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2009.&#91;12&#93; He was sworn into office by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on January 7, 2010.&#91;13&#93;&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93;<br/>Emergency management<br/>On his fifth day as Administrator, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Port-au-Prince, Haiti, that destroyed the capital and killed more than 200,000 citizens. Shah was tasked by President Obama to lead the United States response to the disaster, launching one of the largest humanitarian efforts in history.&#91;16&#93;<br/>USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah listens to the story of a young Somali woman who walked for 33 days with her children to reach Dadaab camp in Kenya.<br/>Throughout his tenure, Shah would lead the U.S. Government response to major crises and natural disasters including the famine in the Horn of Africa where more than 13 million people were in need of assistance.&#91;17&#93;<br/>In 2014, Shah led the U.S. response to the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. Shah played a critical role in mitigating the crisis, working closely with the President and other senior leaders&#91;18&#93; leading to reducing significant transmission across Africa and to other parts of the world.&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;<br/>Reforming USAID<br/>In addition to overseeing America's response to international crises and humanitarian assistance, Shah worked to reform how USAID conducted business. He promoted a new model of development based on engagement with the private sector.&#91;23&#93; As co-chair of the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR), a comprehensive evaluation led by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to redefine diplomacy and development, Shah worked to incorporate development as a part of an integrated, values-driven national security strategy.&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93; He earned bipartisan support for his efforts, which included increasing his Agency's budget growth during a time of sequestration.&#91;26&#93;<br/>U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah responding to questions on the flooding in Pakistan at the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C., on August 4, 2010.<br/>Internally, Shah launched USAID Forward, a set of reforms that touched nearly every part of the Agency, including contractor and procurement policies.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93;&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93; He returned budget and policy oversight back to USAID from the State Department, recruited top talent from other fields, increased the number of foreign service officers, and established the Administrator's Leadership Council.<br/>Food security reform<br/>Shah led efforts to reform food security in an effort to fight against hunger around the world.&#91;32&#93; His efforts had a broad, bipartisan coalition in support of global development in the United States Congress, resulting in a fivefold increase in America's overall investment in fighting hunger through investments in agriculture. Shah used the Camp David G8 Summit in 2012 to attract private investment commitments to the effort.&#91;33&#93; The U.S. Government's Feed the Future initiative has been documented to have moved nearly 40 million people out of hunger and poverty and led to dramatic reductions in child stunting around the world.&#91;34&#93;&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93;&#91;37&#93;<br/>Maternal and child health<br/>As Administrator of USAID, Shah restructured $2.9 billion of global health investments to focus on cost-effective ways to save lives of children under the age of five in priority countries.&#91;38&#93; He created a partnership co-led by Ethiopia, India and UNICEF, \"A Promise Renewed\", to have more than one hundred partner countries restructure health priorities and invest in measurement to deliver better outcomes.&#91;39&#93; As a result of these and other efforts, the global level of child deaths is coming down faster than previously expected.&#91;40&#93;<br/>U.S. Global Development Lab<br/>Shah continued building on his new model of development in 2014 when he announced the establishment of the United States Global Development Lab.&#91;41&#93;&#91;42&#93; The Lab brings together public and private sector partners to support innovative development solutions in areas that include water, health, food security, nutrition, energy, education and climate change. The U.S. Global Development Lab, a key recommendation of the first QDDR, increased the number of scientists and technology experts within USAID, including 65 fellows from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). He increased the investment in science, technology and innovation, taking Agency spend from roughly $130 million when he became Administrator to over $600 million, to focus not only on research, but also on innovation and applied solutions in science and technology.&#91;43&#93;<br/>President Obama talks with advisors aboard Air Force One during a flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town, South Africa, June 30, 2013.

(Official White House Photo by Pete Souza)<br/>At the launch of the Lab in New York, Shah stated: \"To solve our most intractable development challenges, USAID has established a new way of working, bringing on board the best and brightest staff and new partners, all working in concert to help end extreme poverty. The Lab will engage a global community of inventors, academics, researchers, entrepreneurs, investors, and corporate leaders in science and technology to invent, test, and scale the most promising and cost effective solutions to end extreme poverty.\"&#91;44&#93;<br/>Power Africa<br/>In 2013, President Obama launched Power Africa, bringing together technical and legal experts, the private sector, and governments from around the world to work in partnership to increase the number of people with access to power.&#91;45&#93;&#91;46&#93; As Administrator, Shah led the Administration's efforts to secure billions of dollars of private investments for African power development to bring more than 26,000 MW of power online.&#91;47&#93;<br/>National Prayer Breakfast<br/>In 2014, Administrator Shah was invited to keynote the 62nd Annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC.&#91;48&#93;&#91;49&#93;<br/>Raj Shah briefs Dr. Jill Biden, Dr. Bill Frist and others en route to Dagahaley refugee camp, Aug. 8, 2011. (Official White House Photo by David Lienemann)<br/>Bipartisan outreach<br/>To institutionalize efforts to transform development, Shah worked closely with Congressional leaders and a broad range of non-government stakeholders on a select set of legislative priorities. In recent years, President Obama has signed many of these into law. The Global Food Security Act is the second largest global development authorizing legislation in recent history.&#91;50&#93; The Electrify Africa Act has institutionalized Power Africa and the Agriculture Act (\"Farm Bill\") included the most significant legislative reforms in American food aid in sixty years.&#91;51&#93;&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93;&#91;54&#93; Shah's effort to enlist Congress as a real partner and build a broad bipartisan coalition to support these priorities is credited in large part for their passage.&#91;55&#93;<br/>Later career<br/>After Shah resigned from USAID on January 30, 2015,&#91;56&#93; he was appointed Distinguished Fellow in Residence at Georgetown University, Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, developing and teaching a graduate seminar on Rethinking Global Development and National Security policy with an emphasis on fragile states, data and innovation.&#91;57&#93; He also founded and serves as Managing Partner for Latitude Capital, a global emerging markets power and infrastructure private equity firm.&#91;58&#93;<br/>USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah joined President Barack Obama in the Situation Room of the White House concerning the earthquake in Chile, Feb. 27, 2010.

The panel presented their findings and recommendations to the Secretary General, UN General Assembly, and the G8 and G20 groups of leaders.&#91;59&#93;<br/>TEDxPennsylvaniaAvenue<br/>In 2015, Shah delivered a TED talk Data-Driven Compassion: What Haiti, Somalia & Ebola Teach Us at the inaugural TEDxPennsylvaniaAvenue, which was designed \"to give several of the world's most innovative thinkers and doers the opportunity to share their ground-breaking ideas with bipartisan leaders in our nation's capital.\"&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93;<br/>Moneyball for Government<br/>Shah co-authored a bipartisan chapter in the second edition of the book, Moneyball for Government, with Michael Gerson, former Assistant to the President for Policy & Strategic Planning under President George W. Bush.&#91;62&#93; The chapter, titled \"Foreign Assistance and the Revolution of Rigor\", calls for data and evidence to drive U.S. foreign aid and provides a roadmap for improving and sustaining foreign assistance programs.&#91;63&#93;<br/>Shah and Gerson also co-authored an op-ed in the Washington Post on Zika.&#91;64&#93;<br/>The Rockefeller Foundation<br/>On January 5, 2017, the Board of Trustees announced the unanimous selection of Shah to serve as the thirteenth president of the Rockefeller Foundation.&#91;65&#93; He assumed office on March 1, 2017, succeeding Dr. Judith Rodin, who had served as president for nearly twelve years. Shah is the first-ever Indian-American to serve as president of the foundation.&#91;66&#93;&#91;67&#93; The mission of the Foundation is to improve the lives of humanity around the world.&#91;68&#93;<br/>Awards and recognition<br/>Shah has been the recipient of numerous awards including the Secretary of State's Distinguished Service Award (2013); the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award, the highest official honor for non-resident Indian, awarded by the President of India (2011);&#91;69&#93; the U.S. Global Leadership Council Tribute Award (2014); the Gene White Lifetime Achievement Award for Child Nutrition (2014); the Young Global Leader, World Economic Forum (2007); The 2010 Joseph Wharton Award for Social Impact &#91;70&#93; Tufts University (2014); and The University of Virginia Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in Citizen Leadership (2020) &#91;71&#93;<br/>Shah has been awarded numerous honorary degrees including American University, Doctor of International Affairs (2012), Tuskegee University, Doctor of Science (2012), and Colby College, Doctor of Laws (2011).&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>Shah was also recognized as one of Fortune Magazine's 40 under 40 in 2011 and was India Abroad's Person of the Year in 2012.&#91;72&#93;&#91;73&#93;<br/>2020 Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medalist in Citizen Leadership&#91;74&#93;<br/>Board and affiliations<br/>Shah currently sits on numerous boards including Trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation,&#91;75&#93; International Rescue Committee, Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Results for America, Trilateral Commission the Atlantic Council and The National Geographic Society.&#91;76&#93; He is also a member on the Council of Foreign Relations&#91;77&#93; On January 4, 2017 he was elected President of the Rockefeller Foundation, the first Indian-American to hold that post.&#91;78&#93;<br/>Past Board memberships including Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), Seattle Public Library, Seattle Community College District, City Year Seattle and Project Impact for South Asian Americans.&#91;79&#93;&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>Personal life<br/>Shah is married to Shivam Mallick Shah.

He was committed both to basic research and its practical applications. From the start, Pasteur brought together scientists with various specialties. The first five departments were directed by two normaliens (graduates of the &#201;cole Normale Sup&#233;rieure), &#201;mile Duclaux (general microbiology research) and Charles Chamberland (microbes research applied to hygiene), a biologist, Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov (morphological microbe research), and two physicians, Jacques-Joseph Grancher (rabies) and Emile Roux (technical microbe research). One year after the inauguration of the Institut Pasteur, Roux set up the first course of microbiology ever taught in the world, Cours de Microbie Technique (Course of microbe research techniques).<br/>Pasteur's successors have sustained this tradition, which is reflected in the Institut Pasteur's unique history of accomplishment:<br/>Emile Roux and Alexandre Yersin discovered the mechanism of action of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and how to treat diphtheria with antitoxins<br/>Alexandre Yersin discovered in 1894 the pathogen of bubonic plague, Yersinia pestis<br/>Paul-Louis Simond discovered in 1898 the role of the flea in the transmission of plague<br/>Albert Calmette and Camille Gu&#233;rin discovered how to culture the tuberculosis bacillus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (so called BCG or Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#233;rin) at Institut Pasteur de Lille, and developed in 1921 the first effective anti-tuberculosis vaccine<br/>Alphonse Laveran received the 1907 Nobel Prize for his research on the role of protozoans as disease agents (notably, his discovery of the malaria hematozoon)<br/>Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov received the Nobel Prize in 1908 for contributions to scientific understanding of the immune system<br/>Constantin Levaditi and Karl Landsteiner demonstrated in 1910 that poliomyelitis is due to a filterable virus<br/>F&#233;lix d'Herelle discovered in 1917 the bacteriophage, a virus that spread only inside bacteria<br/>Jules Bordet received the Nobel prize in 1919 for his discoveries on immunity, especially the implication of antibodies and the complement system&#8242;s mechanisms of action<br/>Charles Nicolle received the Nobel prize in 1928 for unravelling the mystery of how typhus is transmitted, especially the role of the louse<br/>Jean Laigret developed in 1932 the first vaccine for yellow fever<br/>Andr&#233; Lwoff established in 1951 the existence of proviruses, a work honored by the 1965 Nobel Prize<br/>Jacques Monod and Francois Jacob discovered the mechanism of genes' transcription regulation, a work honored by the 1965 Nobel Prize<br/>Pierre L&#233;pine developed in 1955 one of the first anti-polio vaccines<br/>Jean-Pierre Changeux isolated in 1970 the first receptor to a neurotransmitter, the acetylcholine receptor.<br/>Luc Montagnier, Fran&#231;oise Barr&#233;-Sinoussi and colleagues discovered the two HIV viruses that cause AIDS in 1983 and 1985; Montagnier and Barr&#233;-Sinoussi were honored by the 2008 Nobel Prize<br/>The institute's biggest mistake was ignoring a dissertation by Ernest Duchesne on the use of Penicillium glaucum to cure infections in 1897. The early exploitation of his discovery might have saved millions of lives, especially in World War I.<br/>A new age of preventive medicine in France was made possible by the Institut Pasteur's (early 20th century) development of vaccines for tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, yellow fever and poliomyelitis. The discovery and use of sulfonamides in treating infections was another of its earlier breakthroughs. Some researchers won fame by discovering antitoxins, while Daniel Bovet received the 1957 Nobel Prize for his discoveries on synthetic anti-histamines and curarizing compounds.<br/>Since World War II, Pasteur researchers have focused sharply on molecular biology. Their achievements were recognized in 1965, when the Nobel Prize was shared by Fran&#231;ois Jacob, Jacques Monod and Andr&#233; Lwoff for their work on the regulation of viruses. In 1985, the first human vaccine obtained by genetic engineering from animal cells, the vaccine against hepatitis B, was developed by Pierre Tiollais and collaborators.<br/>The building hosting the Museum and the funeral chapel of Pasteur<br/>The Institute's opening<br/>Although the center against rabies, directed by Jacques-Joseph Grancher and &#201;mile Roux was more than functional, it became so overcrowded that it became necessary to build a structure that Pasteur had been calling with the name &#8220;Institute Pasteur&#8221; long before it was even built. Since Pasteur could not, for health reasons, do it himself, he delegated the task of the project and of creating the new building, situated on rue Dutot, to two of his most trusted colleagues, Grancher and Emile Duclaux.&#91;2&#93;:65<br/>From the beginning the Institute experienced some economical difficulties that it was able to overcome thanks to the help of the government, some foreign rulers and Madame Boucicaut, but this aid would not in any way restrain its independence, therefore respecting Pasteur's most important prerogative. The million francs left unused would not be sufficient to provide for the institute's needs for long, but the prestige and the social benefits it would bring to France justified and motivated the subsidy it would receive; also the money brought in from selling the vaccines in France and in the rest of the world would help in supporting it. In 1888 this foundation, which had obtained the full approval from the government, began to function, and from the beginning it was involved in the development and changes that France underwent during the last decades of the 19th century.&#91;2&#93;:68<br/>The statutes drawn by Pasteur and later approved by Duclaux and Grancher define, besides its absolute freedom and independence, the institute's internal structure: a rabies division controlled by Grancher, an anthrax one in Chamberland&#8217;s hands, who also supervised the department of microbiology, while Emile Roux dealt with microbial methods applied to medicine.<br/>The Institute during World War I and World War II<br/>Men and woman working in classroom at the Institut Pasteur, ca. 1920<br/>During the First World War the institute was not only involved in the prevention of sanitary risks but also had to deal with the demands of the moment. The most urgent matter was to vaccinate the troops against typhoid fever, easily contracted by the soldiers who often had no choice but to drink from small streams or puddles from the last rain. By September 1914, the institute was able to provide 670,000 doses of the needed vaccine and continued to produce it throughout the conflict. It is important to note that the war brought to light germs that during times of peace were concealed deep within the soil or in pockets of putrefaction and therefore it revealed the true nature and severity of some types of pathogens that would otherwise have remained unknown. That's how Michel Weinberg, Metchnikoff's scholar, disclosed the complex etiology of gas gangrene and created a vaccine for each one of the anaerobes associated with it.&#91;2&#93;:147&#91;3&#93; The First World War involved science in warfare: a movement of active participation arose among researchers who felt the need to help France win the war. This is why Gabriel Bertrand, with Roux's authorization, crafted a grenade based on chloropicrin and Fourneau discovered the chemical reaction that led to the formation of methylarsine chloride, whose effects are even worse than the ones of other poisonous gases used during the war.<br/>In 1938 the institute, despite its relative poverty, built a biochemical division and another one dedicated to cellular pathology, whose direction was entrusted to the hands of Boivin (who went on to discover endotoxins that are contained in the germ's body and are freed after its death). During the same period, Andre Lwoff assumed the direction of a new microbial physiology branch built on rue Dutot.&#91;2&#93;:205 The general mobilization after France's declaration of war against Germany, in September 1939, emptied the Institute and significantly reduced its activities, as members of appropriate age and condition were recruited into the army, but the almost total absence of battles during the first months of the conflict helped maintain the sanitary situation on the front. After the occupation of France, the Germans never tried to gather information from the institute's research; their confidence in Germany's advantage in this field decreased their curiosity, and their only interest was in the serums and vaccines that it could provide to their troops or the European auxiliaries they recruited. This relative freedom allowed the institute to become, during the two years after the occupation, a great pharmacy for the Resistance thanks to the initiative of Vallery-Radot, Pasteur's nephew. The Germans became suspicious of the institute's staff only after an outbreak of typhoid in a Wehrmacht division that was stationed near Paris before being sent to the Russian front.&#91;2&#93;:209&#8211;210 The cause of the epidemic was later found to be due to a member of the Institute stealing a culture of the germ responsible for the disease and, with the collaboration of an accomplice, infecting a large quantity of butter used to feed German troops. The fact that the epidemic spread after the Germans sold some of the butter to civilians was proof that the illness's breakout was not caused by local water quality. Afterwards, the German authorities ordered that the institute's stores containing microbial cultures could be opened only by authorized members; similar security problems also induced them to demand complete lists of the staff's names and functions; missing names caused the Germans to send two very valuable biologists, Dr. Wolmann and his wife, as well as other three lab assistants, to a concentration camp. The institute was not a location for German entrenchment even during the battles for Paris's liberation because of the honor and respect it commanded, as well as out of fear that involving it in any type of conflict might &#8220;free the ghosts of long defeated diseases&#8221;.&#91;2&#93;:213<br/>The Institute's economical difficulties during the Seventies<br/>At the end of 1973 the institute's economic status was so worrisome that its troubles aroused the public's interest: no one could believe that an institution which was to provide vaccines and serums for more that fifty million people could be undergoing such big financial problems, an institution that furthermore was believed to be under government protection &#8211; like the Bank of France &#8211; and therefore shielded from bankruptcy. The causes of the decadence that brought the institute to financial ruins were numerous, but most of them were associated with its commercial and industrial activities and its management. Both the research and production branch had to endure the recoil caused by financial issues: the research branch didn't receive enough funds and the production branch, which was losing market ground to the new private labs, was immobilized by the antiquated mechanical equipment.<br/>When in 1968, after disappearing for a long period, rabies reappeared in France, the institute, which owed its original celebrity to this disease's vaccine, was replaced by other pharmaceutical industries in the production of the vaccines; yet, despite the deficiencies in the organization's production branch, its members were able to produce, in 1968, over 400,000 doses of vaccine against the Hong Kong influenza.<br/>In 1971 Jacques Monod announced a new era of modernization and development: this new awakening was symbolized by the construction of a new factory where all the production departments were to be reunited. Its construction cost forty-five million francs and the Government, impressed by the institute's will to change, granted it a sum of twenty million francs to bridge the deficit, followed by the people's initiative to also accept a role in the division of the financial responsibilities.&#91;2&#93;:258<br/>The accomplishments of the Institute's members<br/>Roux's cure against diphtheria and studies on syphilis<br/>Production of antiserum at the Institut Pasteur in Paris<br/>Not long after the institute's inauguration, Roux, now less occupied in the fight against rabies, resumed in a new lab and with the help of a new colleague, Yersin, his experiments on diphtheria. This disease used to kill thousands of children every year: an associated condition was commonly called croup, which created fake membranes in the small patients' throats, therefore killing them by suffocation. It was deservedly called &#8220;Horrible monster, sparrowhawk of the shadows&#8221; by Victor Hugo in his Art of being a grandfather. The painter Albert Gustaf Aristides Edelfelt made a famous painting portraying Pasteur in his laboratory while he was trying to cure this illness, which was fought at the times through procedures that were just as cruel as the illness itself.<br/>Roux and Yersin grew the bacillus that causes it and studied, thanks to various experiments they did on rabbits, its pathogenic power and symptoms, like the paralysis of the respiratory muscles.&#91;2&#93;:73 It is this last consequence of the diphtheria that provided the two researchers with a valuable clue of the nature of the disease, since it is caused by an intoxication due to a toxin introduced into the organism by the bacillus, that while secreting this particular venom is able to multiply itself: they were therefore inclined to think that the bacillus owed its virulence to the toxin. After filtrating the microbial culture of the Corynebacterium diphtheriae and injecting it into the lab animals, they were able to observe all the typical signs of the sickness. Roux and Yersin established that they were dealing with a new type of bacillus, not only able to proliferate and abundantly reproduce itself, but also capable of spreading at the same time a powerful venom, and they deduced that it can play the role of antigen, that is if they could overcome the delicate moment of its injection, made especially dangerous by the toxin.&#91;2&#93;:74 Some German researchers had also discovered the diphtheria toxin and were trying to immunize some guinea pigs through the use of a vaccine: one of them, Von Behring, Robert Koch's student, stated that he was able to weaken small doses of the toxin. Nonetheless Roux was not convinced by this result, since no-one knew the collateral effects of the procedure, and preferred to use serotherapy since more than one lab study &#8211; like the one accomplished by Charles Richet &#8211; demonstrated that the serum of an animal vaccinated against the disease included the antibodies needed to defeat it. The anti-diphtheria serum which was able to agglutinate the bacteria and neutralize the toxin was supplied by a horse inoculated with the viral germs, and it was separated from the blood drawn from the horses&#8217; jugular vein. Like it happened for his teacher with the anti-rabies vaccine, Roux needed to test the effectiveness of the product he elaborated, and endured all the stress and ethical dilemmas that the first use of such a risky but also groundbreaking procedure implied. To test the serum two groups of children were chosen from two different hospitals: in the first one, which received the serum, 338 out of 449 children survived, in the latter one, treated with the customary therapies, only 204 out of 520 survived. Once the results were made public by Le Figaro newspaper, a subscription fund was opened to raise the money needed to provide the Institute the number of horses necessary to produce enough serum to satisfy the national demand.&#91;2&#93;:82<br/>After Duclaux's death, Roux took his place as head of the institute, and the last research he carried out was the one on syphilis, a dangerous disease because of its immediate effects and the hereditary repercussions that result from it. Despite Fournier&#8217;s considerable work, van Swieten&#8217;s liquid mercury was still the only known cure, although its results were doubtful and uncertain. The search for a stronger remedy against this disease was made more difficult because most animals are immune to it: it was thus not possible to experiment possible cures and study their likely side effects.&#91;2&#93;:128 The sexually transmittable Treponema pallidum (the syphilis germ), detected by two German biologists, Schaudinn and Hoffmann, affects only the human race &#8211; where it resides in sperm, ulceration and cancers that it is able to cause &#8211; and, as it will be later discovered, some anthropoid apes, especially chimpanzees. Both Roux and Metchnikoff, consequent to the discovery that this type of ape can be contaminated with the illness, contributed with their research in creating a vaccine, while Bordet and Wassermann elaborated a solution that was able to expose the germ&#8217;s presence in human blood. Even though it was not yet a completely reliable solution, it represented a noteworthy evolution compared to the previous medicines used against syphilis.&#91;2&#93;:129<br/>Metchnikoff&#8217;s phagocytosis theory<br/>Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov already announced the &#8220;principle of immunization&#8221; during his voluntary exile in Italy, where he went to undertake some studies, the results of which he had promptly communicated to Pasteur. The phagocytosis theory is based on the notion that phagocytes are cells that have the power to englobe foreign bodies &#8211; and above all bacteria &#8211; introduced inside an organism. German biologists opposed to his doctrine the humoral theory: they claimed to have found in Roux's serum some substances able to reveal the presence of microbes, and to ensure their destruction if properly stimulated. The German scientist Eduard Buchner referred to these substances as &#8220;alexine&#8221; and two other biologists, Von Behring and Kitasato, demonstrated their lytic power towards bacteria.&#91;2&#93;:83 In 1894 one of these scientist published the result of an experiment that appeared to completely refute Metchnikoff's ideas: using the cholera vibrio, discovered ten years before by Robert Koch, as an antigen, Richard F. J. Pfeiffer introduced it in the abdomen of a guinea pig already vaccinated against this disease, and was able to observe the destruction of the vibrio in the local blood plasma, without the participation of the phagocytes. Not even this study was able to shake Metchnikoff's belief and faith in his theory, and his ideas, as well as Pfeiffer's and Buchner's, would all contribute to the elaboration of the current theory of the immune system.<br/>Yersin's studies on the plague<br/>Yersin, after his research with Roux, abruptly left the Institute for personal reasons, without losing Pasteur's benevolence, who never doubted that the young man was destined to great things in the scientific area and would contribute in spreading Pasteur's discoveries around the world. The news of a violent plague outburst in Yunman enabled Yersin to truly show and reach his potential as he was summoned, as Pasteur's scholar, to conduct a microbiological research of the disease. The plague he had to deal with was the bubonic plague, which is recognizable most of the time through the abscesses, known as buboes, it provokes in its victims. Yersin looked for the germ responsible for the infection specifically in these plague-spots, tumors caused by the inflammation of the lymphatic glands which become black because of the necrosis of the tissue.&#91;2&#93;:91 After many microscopic exams he was able to state that in most of the cases the bubonic plague bacterium was located in these buboes; but in the meanwhile the Japanese scientist Kitasato also declared that he had isolated the bacterium, even though the description he provided was dissimilar to the one given by Yersin. Therefore, although at first named &#8220;Kitasato-Yersin bacillus&#8221; by the scientific community, the microbe will later assume only the latter's name because the one identified by Kitasato, a type of streptococcus, cannot be found in the lymphatic glands. However it is Paul-Louis Simond who was the first to understand and describe the etiology of the plague and its modality of contamination: he observes all over the bodies of the people affected by it small flea-bites, which he also found on the bodies of the dead rats that were always linked to the plague, and then deduced that the fleas which carried the bacteria were its true vector or source, and that they transmitted the illness by jumping from the dead rats' bodies to the human ones and biting them.&#91;2&#93;:94<br/>Paul-Louis Simond injecting a plague vaccine on the 4th of June 1898 in the Vishandas Hospital, Karachi<br/>Calmette's and Guerin's anti-tuberculosis vaccine<br/>By the beginning of the 20th century, the improvement of the general life conditions and the development of a more extensive conception of hygiene produced in France a slight regression in tuberculosis cases: nonetheless the institute's labs, like many other ones, kept trying to find among the Koch's bacillus many singularities the one that would allow them to find an antidote to its terrible consequences. Right after he had discovered the bacillus, Koch had tried in vain to create a vaccine against it, however the injection of the filtrate he had prepared, later called tuberculin, had the effect of revealing who was phthisic from who wasn't by causing in the latter&#8212;and not in the former&#8212;fever and light trembling.<br/>The institute's newspaper was filled at the time with articles regarding tuberculosis, some of which written by Albert Calmette, who extended his research to a socio-professional category which was extremely affected by it, that is the miners in whom this disease is often anticipated or accompanied by silicosis and anchylostomiasis (caused by a small intestinal worm that creates a state of anemia propitious to tuberculosis).&#91;2&#93;:140 After finding a better solution to anchylostomiasis, he focused on creating a vaccine using the bacillus responsible for bovine tuberculosis, very similar to the human one, as it caused almost the same symptoms. Having observed that most actinomycetales are saprophytes, that is able to survive outside of living organisms, with the help of a veterinary, Camille Guerin, he attempted to create a special nutritious environment for the bacillus that, in time, altered its features by eliminating the virulence and leaving only the antigenic power. Both of the scientist knew that this arduous task would require a lot of effort and time, because it was necessary to act on a large number of generations to change the genetic foundation of a species, nevertheless the velocity of the bacteria's reproduction allowed, since it was constantly monitored, to interfere with an important phase of its evolution. The environment deemed appropriate for the denaturation of the Mycobacterium bovis was a compost of potatoes cooked in the bile of an ox treated with glycerine, and Calmette re-inseminated it every three weeks for thirteen years, while checking for an enfeeblement of the pathogenic power of the bacillus. Having finally lost completely its virulence, the bovine tuberculosis germ grown with their method was the principal prophylactic weapon against human tuberculosis, and it helped to reduce considerably the frequency of this disease.<br/>While experimenting on chimpanzees in Kindia, on which he was able to test exhaustively his vaccine, Calmette also discovered that it can notably weaken some leprosy manifestations &#8211; its bacillus presents some similarities with Koch's.&#91;2&#93;:186<br/>Calmette's work in Saigon<br/>In Saigon Albert Calmette also created the first overseas branch of the institute, where he produced an amount of smallpox and rabies vaccines sufficient to satisfy the needs of the population, and started a study on venomous snakes, particularly cobras. During these studies Calmette discovered that the power of the venom, as well as that of tetanus, could be annihilated by the use of alkaline hypochlorites, and was able therefore to create a serum, effective if injected right after the cobra's bite. Back in France, he acquired enough snakes to continue his work and create serum for the local population.&#91;2&#93;:98<br/>Nicolle's work on epidemic typhus<br/>The scientist and writer Charles Nicolle while in Tunis studied how epidemic typhus &#8211; known for the red spots it left on sick people that disappeared before their death &#8211; was transmitted. His insight into the mode of transmission occurred while he was visiting the hospital: patients were washed and given clean clothes on admission, and no new cases occurred within the hospital. This made him realise that the vector of the disease were lice that were discarded with the patient's own clothes.&#91;4&#93; Nicolle managed to attract H&#233;l&#232;ne Sparrow to be Laboratory Chief in Tunis. She had worked with Rudolf Weigl who had developed a vaccine, and she was able to introduce this to Tunisia as the start of a public health programme to control the disease.&#91;5&#93; Nevertheless, three other scientists identified the bacterium responsible for the disease: Ricketts, Russell Morse Wilder (1885&#8211;1959), and Prowazek, who called it Rickettsia prowazekii.&#91;2&#93;:101<br/>Chantemesse's typhoid vaccine<br/>During the summer of 1900, the extremely hot weather and scarcity of the water supply in Paris, usually ensured by the Ourcq channel and by the de la Dhuis aqueduct, forced the authorities to pump water directly from the Seine, which, despite filtering, led to a sudden and alarming outbreak of typhoid cases in Paris. The cause of the disease, a bacillus that was discovered almost twenty years before by the German bacteriologist Karl Joseph Eberth and that looks like a bodyless spider, was constantly present in this river and not even pouring extensive quantities of ozone and of lime permanganate into its water was enough to exterminate the bacteria.&#91;2&#93;:111 The difficulty in creating a vaccine is caused by the nature of the germ's endotoxins. Unlike diphtheria, which releases toxins via exocytotic secretion, typhoid pathogens encapsulate endotoxins which survive even after the death of the bacillus.<br/>After working in the rabies division of Rue Vaquelin and studying the microbe that causes dysentery, Andr&#233; Chantemesse collaborated with a younger bacteriologist, Georges-Fernand Widal. Together they were able to immunize guinea pigs by inoculating them with heat-treated dead bacteria, calling into question the notion that only weakened, not dead, bacteria can be used to immunize.&#91;2&#93;:112 They concluded that a series of three or four early injections of such heat-inactivated bacteria can effectively inoculate against development of the disease, as the endotoxins alone are sufficient to trigger the production of antibodies.<br/>Fourneau and the Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry<br/>Regarding curative medicine, it was in 1911 that it took off at the Institut Pasteur, when Ernest Fourneau created the Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, which he directed until 1944, and from which emerged numerous drugs, among which one can mention the first pentavalent arsenical treatment (Stovarsol), the first synthetic alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist (Prosympal), the first antihistamine (Piperoxan), the first active drug on heart rate (Dacorene) or the first synthetic no-depolarising muscle relaxant (Flaxedil). The discovery of the therapeutic properties of sulfanilamide by Tr&#233;fou&#235;l, Nitti and Bovet, in the laboratory of Fourneau, paved the way for the sulfamidotherapy.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;<br/>The Hospital Pasteur<br/>The Hospital Pasteur was built during the first years of the 20th century in front of the institute, and was employed for a long time by the members as a field for clinical observation and experimentations of therapeutical processes elaborated by themselves. Since in the beginning it was provided with only 120 beds, every patient was so well isolated in his private room that each room could be almost considered a small pest house, ideal for quarantine. The construction of the hospital was enabled by the gift of a rich benefactor, Madame Lebaudy, while the money offered by another rich woman, the baroness Hirsch, was used to build a vast pavilion that accommodated the Department of Chemical Biology of the institute.&#91;2&#93;:118<br/>Duclaux work in the chemical biology department<br/>The work done in the new pavilion by Duclaux clarified how the human body accomplished some of its vital functions, and brought to light the role of a diastase. It was critical in resolving a controversy aroused between Pasteur and Berthelot after the publication of Claude Bernard&#8217;s posthumous essay regarding the nature of the agents implicated in some transformations that happen inside plants, like fermentation. While Pasteur believed that the only substance implied in the process of fermentation was yeast, Bernard &#8211; and Berthelot in his own way &#8211; believed that some other soluble ferment was involved: the German chemist Eduard Buchner later demonstrated the existence of this &#8220;ferment&#8221;, an intracellular diastase which he called &#8220;zymase,&#8221; what we know now as enzymes. Duclaux's study on the metabolism of nutrients did not have immediate practical applications, but later revealed how extensive is the field of enzymes and opened new roads that would lead biology to extend the knowledge on life's mechanisms on a molecular level.&#91;2&#93;:119<br/>Pasteur's museum and tomb<br/>The Mus&#233;e Pasteur (Pasteur Museum)&#91;8&#93; is located in the south wing of the first building occupied by the Institut Pasteur, which was inaugurated on November 14, 1888. Established in 1936, this museum preserves the memory of Louis Pasteur's life and work in the vast apartment where he lived during the last seven years of his life, from 1888 to 1895.

Hutchinson (1909&#8211;1997). The Foundation was dedicated to the study of heart surgery, cancer, and diseases of the endocrine system. Hutchinson's younger brother Fred (1919&#8211;1964), was a major league pitcher and manager who died of lung cancer at age 45. The next year, William Hutchinson established the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center as a division of the Pacific Northwest Research Foundation.&#91;2&#93;<br/>In 1972, with the help of Senator Warren G. Magnuson, PNRF received federal funding under the National Cancer Act of 1971 to create in Seattle one of the 15 new NCI-designated Cancer Centers aimed at conducting basic research&#91;4&#93; called for under 1971 Act; the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center became independent 1972 and its building opened three years later in 1975.&#91;2&#93;&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93;:3,5 The center was named an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in 1976.&#91;9&#93;<br/>In 1998, the center formed the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA), a separate nonprofit corporation,&#91;10&#93; with UW Medicine, and Seattle Children's. This solidified the center's reach into clinical care and was essential for it retaining its NCI comprehensive center designation;&#91;11&#93; the designation was extended to the center's consortium including the SCCA in 2003.&#91;9&#93; SCCA's outpatient clinic first opened in January 2001.&#91;11&#93;<br/>In 2001, The Seattle Times published a series of articles alleging that investigators at the center (including the Center's co-founder E. Donnall Thomas) were conducting unethical clinical studies on cancer patients. The paper alleged that in two cancer studies conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s, patients were not informed about all the risks of the study, nor about the study doctors' financial interest in study outcome. The paper also alleged that this financial interest may have contributed to the doctors' failure to halt the studies despite evidence that patients were dying sooner and more frequently than expected.&#91;12&#93; In response, the center formed a panel of independent experts to review its existing research practices, leading to adoption of new conflict-of-interest rules.&#91;13&#93;<br/>In 2010 Lawrence Corey was appointed as the 4th President, following the retirement of Lee Hartwell. He was followed by Gary Gilliland in 2015 as president, who led the institute until 2020.&#91;14&#93; &#91;15&#93; &#91;16&#93; Under his leadership the center announced that it would expand into the former Lake Union steam plant, which previously housed ZymoGenetics.&#91;17&#93; The move was completed in October 2020.&#91;18&#93; In February 2020, Thomas J. Lynch Jr. took over as director.&#91;19&#93;<br/>2014 saw the organization adopt its longtime local nickname, \"Fred Hutch\", as its official name as part of a rebranding.&#91;20&#93;<br/>Notable faculty<br/>The center has employed three recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine:<br/>Linda Buck, Ph.D., who received the award in 2004 for solving many details of the olfactory system;&#91;21&#93; and<br/>E. Donnall Thomas, M.D., who received the award in 1990 for his pioneering work in bone-marrow transplantation and who died in 2012;&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93; and<br/>Lee Hartwell, Ph.D., who received the honor in 2001 for his discoveries regarding the mechanisms that control cell division.&#91;24&#93; After retiring from leading the center in 2010, Hartwell left to join Arizona State University.&#91;25&#93;<br/>Commercialization<br/>The center is active in technology transfer. In 2013, it was one of the top ten biomedical research institutions in the field (excluding universities); it made 18 new deals with companies to develop inventions made at the center, and earned $10,684,882 in income from past deals it had signed.&#91;26&#93; Most notably, Juno Therapeutics, a company developing CAR-T immunotherapy for cancer and that raised $314 million in venture capital investments and had a $265 million initial public offering in 2014, was started based on inventions made at the center.&#91;27&#93; As of 2015, about twenty companies had been started based on center inventions since 1975, including Immunex and Icos.&#91;27&#93;<br/>Campus<br/>The institute's main campus consists of thirteen buildings on fifteen acres (6.1 ha) in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle.&#91;28&#93;<br/>In 1987, the center began exploring possible new homes to replace its 9-building campus on First Hill that it was set to outgrow.&#91;29&#93;&#91;30&#93; A site in the South Lake Union neighborhood, envisioned by the city as a future high-tech and biotechnology hub,&#91;31&#93; was chosen in September 1988 after a deal to move to Fremont fell through earlier that year.&#91;32&#93;&#91;33&#93; The first phase of the campus, designed by firm Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership,&#91;34&#93; began construction in 1991 and opened on June 1, 1993 in a ceremony that included the burying of a time capsule set to open in 2093.&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93;<br/>The campus is accessible via the Mercer Street exit of Interstate 5 as well as several public transportation routes, including the South Lake Union Streetcar.&#91;37&#93;<br/><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hutchinson_Cancer_Research_Center\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hutchinson_Cancer_Research_Center</a><br/>"},{"id":142,"title":"Duke University","group":"Organization","image":"img/Duke_University.png","value":1,"notes":""},{"id":143,"title":"Save the Children","group":"Organization","image":"img/Save_the_Children.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/</a><br/>"},{"id":144,"title":"NTI - Nuclear Threat Initiative","group":"Organization","image":"img/NTI_-_Nuclear_Threat_Initiative.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Threat_Initiative\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Threat_Initiative</a><br/>Nuclear Threat Initiative<br/>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>Jump to navigationJump to search<br/>\"NTI\" redirects here.

It serves as the Secretariat for the \"Nuclear Security Project\", in cooperation with the Hoover Institution at Stanford. Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and Nunn (the &#8220;four horsemen of the nuclear apocalypse&#8221;)&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93; guide the project&#8212;an effort to encourage global action to reduce urgent nuclear dangers and build support for reducing reliance on nuclear weapons, ultimately ending them as a threat to the world.&#91;4&#93;<br/>Work<br/>The organization produced the 2005 film, Last Best Chance, which aired on HBO, and the 2010 documentary film Nuclear Tipping Point, which President Obama screened at the White House in April 2010.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;<br/>In 2008, NTI helped create the World Institute for Nuclear Security (WINS), in Vienna, as part of its focus to secure nuclear materials worldwide.&#91;citation needed&#93; UN Security Council Resolution 1887 supported the WINS mission, calling for states to &#8220;share best practices with a view to improved safety standards and nuclear security practices and raise standards of nuclear security to reduce the risk of nuclear terrorism.&#8221;&#91;8&#93; Today, the organization has more than 3,800 members from 118 countries.&#91;9&#93; The Economist wrote, &#8220;WINS is a place where, for the first time, those with the practical responsibility for looking after nuclear materials&#8212;governments, power plant operators, laboratories, universities&#8212;can meet to swap ideas and develop best practices.&#8221;&#91;10&#93;<br/>NTI supported the development of an international low-enriched uranium bank to back up the marketplace and prevent the proliferation of nuclear technology by ensuring that countries will have access to the fuel needed for peaceful purposes.&#91;11&#93; NTI advisor Warren Buffett provided $50 million to jump-start the reserve, which will be owned and managed by the International Atomic Energy Agency and located in Kazakhstan.&#91;12&#93;<br/>NTI produces a biennial \"Nuclear Security Index\" in partnership with the Economist Intelligence Unit.&#91;citation needed&#93; The \"NTI Index\" benchmarks nuclear security conditions across 176 countries and holds governments accountable for properly securing dangerous nuclear materials.&#91;citation needed&#93; According to NTI, The NTI Index, now&#91;when?&#93; in its 3rd edition, is the premiere resource for political leaders, government officials, experts, academics, and the news media worldwide on nuclear materials security.&#91;13&#93;<br/>NTI has developed and released recommendations on securing and eliminating radiological sources used and stored at thousands of sites across more than 100 countries.&#91;citation needed&#93; These sources can be used by terrorists to build radiological &#8220;dirty bombs&#8221; that would incite mass panic, deny access, require extensive and expensive decontamination and have serious economic consequences. Many of these sources, which are used in industry and health-care settings, have minimal or no physical protection&#8212;and technological advances have made it possible to replace many of these sources with safer, effective alternatives.&#91;14&#93;<br/>NTI has received international recognition for work to improve biosecurity, primarily through creating disease surveillance networks.&#91;citation needed&#93; Whether a biological threat is natural or intentional, disease surveillance is a key step in rapid detection and response. Because the response of a health system in one country could have a direct and immediate impact on a neighboring country, or even continent, NTI developed projects that foster cooperation among public health officials across political and geographic boundaries.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>In 2003, NTI created the Middle East Consortium for Infectious Disease Surveillance (MECIDS) with participation from Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority. MECIDS continues to share official health data and conduct infectious disease prevention training.&#91;15&#93;<br/>NTI also created the Connecting Organizations for Disease Surveillance (CORDS), which in 2013 launched as an independent NGO that links international disease surveillance networks,&#91;16&#93; supported by the World Health Organization, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.&#91;17&#93;<br/>Leadership<br/>Ernest J.

Among the prominent former government officials now affiliated with AEI are: AEI Board of Trustees&#91;10&#93; member Dick Cheney, vice president of the United States under George W. Bush; John R. Bolton, former Ambassador to the United Nations; Lynne Cheney, former chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities; and Paul Wolfowitz, former Deputy Secretary of Defense.&#91;11&#93;<br/>Political stance and impact<br/>Although the institute is often cited as a right-leaning counterpart to the left-leaning Brookings Institution,&#91;12&#93;&#91;13&#93; the two entities have often collaborated. From 1998 to 2008, they co-sponsored the AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies, and in 2006 they launched the AEI-Brookings Election Reform Project.&#91;14&#93; In 2015, a working group consisting of members from both institutions coauthored a report entitled Opportunity, Responsibility, and Security: A Consensus Plan for Reducing Poverty and Restoring the American Dream.&#91;15&#93;<br/>AEI is the most prominent think tank associated with American neoconservatism, in both the domestic and international policy arenas.&#91;4&#93; Irving Kristol, widely considered to be one of the founding fathers of neoconservatism, was a senior fellow at AEI (arriving from the Congress for Cultural Freedom following the revelation of that group's CIA funding)&#91;16&#93; and many prominent neoconservatives&#8212;including Jeane Kirkpatrick, Ben Wattenberg, and Joshua Muravchik&#8212;spent the bulk of their careers at AEI.&#91;17&#93;<br/>AEI staff have taken strong stances against the farm bill and agricultural subsidies. A 2007 document authored by Bruce Gardner claimed that \"There is no need for farm subsidies, and it would not really hurt anyone if we eliminated them\".&#91;18&#93;<br/>According to the 2011 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report (Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania), AEI is number 17 in the \"Top Thirty Worldwide Think Tanks\" and number 10 in the \"Top Fifty United States Think Tanks\".&#91;19&#93; As of 2019, the American Enterprise Institute also leads in YouTube subscribers among free-market groups.&#91;20&#93;<br/>History<br/>Beginnings (1938&#8211;1954)<br/>AEI grew out of the American Enterprise Association (AEA), which was founded in 1938 by a group of New York businessmen led by Lewis H. Brown. AEA's original mission was to promote a \"greater public knowledge and understanding of the social and economic advantages accruing to the American people through the maintenance of the system of free, competitive enterprise\".&#91;21&#93; AEI's founders included executives from Eli Lilly, General Mills, Bristol-Myers, Chemical Bank, Chrysler, and Paine Webber.&#91;22&#93;<br/>In 1943, AEA's main offices were moved from New York City to Washington during a time when Congress's portfolio had vastly increased during World War II. AEA opposed the New Deal, and aimed to propound classical liberal arguments for limited government.&#91;citation needed&#93; In 1944, AEA convened an Economic Advisory Board to set a high standard for research; this eventually became the Council of Academic Advisers, which, over the decades, included notable economists and social scientists like Ronald Coase, Martin Feldstein, Milton Friedman, Roscoe Pound, and James Q. Wilson.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>AEA's early work in Washington involved commissioning and distributing legislative analyses to Congress, which developed AEA's relationships with Melvin Laird and Gerald Ford.&#91;23&#93; Brown eventually shifted AEA's focus to commissioning studies of government policies. These subjects ranged from fiscal to monetary policy and from health care to energy, and authors included Earl Butz, John Lintner, former New Dealer Raymond Moley, and Felix Morley. Brown died in 1951, and AEA languished. In 1952, a group of young policymakers and public intellectuals&#8212;including Laird, William J. Baroody Sr., Paul McCracken, and Murray Weidenbaum&#8212;met to discuss resurrecting AEI.&#91;23&#93; In 1954, Baroody became executive vice president of the association.<br/>William J. Baroody Sr. (1954&#8211;1980)<br/>Baroody was executive vice president from 1954 to 1962 and president from 1962 to 1978. Baroody raised money for AEA to expand its financial base beyond the business leaders on the board.&#91;24&#93; During the 1950s, and 1960s, AEA's work became described&#91;by whom?&#93; as more pointed and focused, including monographs by James M. Buchanan, Gottfried Haberler, Edward Banfield, Rose Friedman, P. T. Bauer and Alfred de Grazia.&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93;<br/>The American Enterprise Institute (AEI)&#8212;which had been renamed in 1962&#8212;remained a marginal operation with little practical influence in the national politics until the 1970s.&#91;citation needed&#93; Baroody recruited a resident research faculty; Harvard economist Haberler was the first to join in 1972.&#91;21&#93; In 1977, former president Gerald Ford joined AEI as its \"distinguished fellow.\" Ford brought several of his administration's officials with him, including Arthur Burns, Robert Bork, David Gergen, James C. Miller III, Laurence Silberman, and Antonin Scalia. Ford also founded the AEI World Forum, which he hosted until 2005. Other staff hired around this time included Herbert Stein and Walter Berns. Baroody's son, William J. Baroody Jr., had been an official in the Ford White House and now also joined AEI, taking over the presidency from his father in 1978.&#91;21&#93;<br/>The elder Baroody made a concerted effort to recruit neoconservatives who had supported the New Deal and Great Society but had become disaffected by what they perceived as the failure of the welfare state. This also included Cold War hawks who rejected George McGovern's peace agenda. He brought Irving Kristol, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Michael Novak, and Ben Wattenberg to AEI.&#91;27&#93; While at AEI, Kirkpatrick authored \"Dictatorships and Double Standards\"; it brought her to the attention of Ronald Reagan, and she was later named U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations.&#91;28&#93; AEI also became a home for supply-side economists during the late 1970s and early 1980s.&#91;29&#93; By 1980, AEI had grown from a budget of $1 million and a staff of ten to a budget of $8 million and a staff of 125.&#91;21&#93;<br/>William J. Baroody Jr. (1980&#8211;1986)<br/>Baroody Sr. retired in 1978, and was replaced by his son, William J. Baroody Jr. Baroody Sr. died in 1980, shortly before Ronald Reagan took office as US President.&#91;21&#93;<br/>During the Reagan years, several AEI staff members decamped for the administration. That, combined with prodigious growth, diffusion of research activities,&#91;30&#93;&#91;original research?&#93; and managerial problems, proved costly.&#91;24&#93; Some foundations then supporting AEI perceived a drift toward the center politically. Centrists like Ford, Burns, and Stein clashed with rising movement conservatives. In 1986, the John M. Olin Foundation and the Smith Richardson Foundation withdrew funding for the institute, pushing AEI to the brink of bankruptcy. The board of trustees fired Baroody Jr. and, after an interregnum under interim president Paul McCracken, hired Christopher DeMuth as president in December 1986.&#91;24&#93; DeMuth stayed on for twenty-two years.&#91;31&#93;<br/>Christopher DeMuth (1986&#8211;2008)<br/>Vice President Dick Cheney delivers his remarks on the war on terror, arguing against a withdrawal from Iraq, during a speech on November 21, 2005, at the American Enterprise Institute. Michael Rubin is on the right in the front row.<br/>DeMuth cut AEI's programs and faculty, reorganizing the institute into three primary research areas: economic policy, foreign policy, and social and political studies. He also began fundraising in an effort to regain the confidence of conservative foundations.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>In 1990, AEI hired Charles Murray (and received his Bradley Foundation support for The Bell Curve) after the Manhattan Institute dropped him.&#91;32&#93; Others brought to AEI by DeMuth included John Bolton, Dinesh D'Souza, Richard Cheney, Lynne Cheney, Michael Barone, James K. Glassman, Newt Gingrich, John Lott, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>During the George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations, AEI's revenues grew from $10 million to $18.9 million.&#91;33&#93; The institute's publications Public Opinion and The AEI Economist were merged into The American Enterprise, edited by Karlyn Bowman from 1990&#8211;95 and by Karl Zinsmeister from 1995 to 2006, when Glassman created The American. DeMuth presided over AEI as it moved into the digital age.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>AEI was closely tied to the George W. Bush administration.&#91;34&#93; More than twenty AEI staff members served in the Bush administration, and Bush addressed the institute on three occasions. \"I admire AEI a lot&#8212;I'm sure you know that\", Bush said. \"After all, I have been consistently borrowing some of your best people.\"&#91;35&#93;<br/>Cabinet officials also frequented AEI. In 2002, Danielle Pletka joined AEI to promote the foreign policy department. AEI and several of its staff&#8212;including Michael Ledeen and Richard Perle&#8212;became associated with the start of the Iraq War.&#91;36&#93; President George W. Bush used a February 2003 AEI dinner to advocate for a democratized Iraq, which was intended to inspire the remainder of the Mideast.&#91;37&#93; In 2006&#8211;07, AEI staff, including Frederick W. Kagan, provided a strategic framework for the 2007 surge in Iraq.&#91;38&#93;&#91;39&#93; The Bush administration also drew on AEI work in other areas, such as Leon Kass's appointment as the first chairman of the President's Council on Bioethics and Norman J. Ornstein's work drafting the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act that Bush signed in 2002.<br/>Arthur C. Brooks (2008&#8211;2019)<br/>When DeMuth retired as president at the end of 2008, AEI's staff numbered 185, with 70 scholars and several dozen adjuncts,&#91;21&#93; and revenues of $31.3 million.&#91;40&#93; Arthur C. Brooks succeeded him as president at the start of the Late-2000s recession.&#91;41&#93; In a 2009 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Brooks positioned AEI to be much more aggressive in responding to the policies of the Barack Obama administration.&#91;42&#93; In 2018, Brooks announced that he would step down effective July 1, 2019.&#91;7&#93;<br/>Robert Doar (2019&#8211;present)<br/>In January 2019, Robert Doar was selected by AEI's Board of Trustees to be the Institute's 12th president, succeeding Arthur Brooks on July 1, 2019.&#91;43&#93;<br/>Personnel<br/>AEI's officers include Robert Doar, Danielle Pletka, Yuval Levin, Michael R. Strain, and Ryan Streeter.&#91;44&#93;<br/>AEI has a Council of Academic Advisers, which includes Alan J. Auerbach, Eliot A. Cohen, Eugene Fama, Aaron Friedberg, Robert P. George, Eric A. Hanushek, Walter Russell Mead, Mark V. Pauly, R. Glenn Hubbard, Sam Peltzman, Harvey S. Rosen, Jeremy A. Rabkin, and Richard Zeckhauser. The Council of Academic Advisers selects the annual winner of the Irving Kristol Award.&#91;45&#93;<br/>Board of directors<br/>AEI's board is chaired by Daniel A. D'Aniello. Current notable trustees include:&#91;22&#93;<br/>Former vice president Dick Cheney<br/>John V.

Rose, executive chairman of BNSF Railway<br/>Mel Sembler, chairman emeritus of the Sembler Company<br/>Research programs<br/>AEI's research is divided into seven broad categories: economic policy studies, foreign and defense policy studies, health care policy studies, political and public opinion studies, social and cultural studies, education, and poverty studies. Until 2008, AEI's work was divided into economics, foreign policy, and politics and social policy. AEI research is presented at conferences and meetings, in peer-reviewed journals and publications on the institute's website, and through testimony before and consultations with government panels.&#91;citation needed&#93;&#91;46&#93;<br/>Economic policy studies<br/>Economic policy was the original focus of the American Enterprise Association, and \"the Institute still keeps economic policy studies at its core\".&#91;40&#93; According to AEI's annual report, \"The principal goal is to better understand free economies&#8212;how they function, how to capitalize on their strengths, how to keep private enterprise robust, and how to address problems when they arise\". Michael R. Strain directs economic policy studies at AEI. Throughout the beginning of the 21st-century, AEI staff have pushed for a more conservative approach to aiding the recession that includes major tax-cuts. AEI supported President Bush's tax cuts in 2002 and claimed that the cuts \"played a large role in helping to save the economy from a recession\". AEI also suggested that further taxes were necessary in order to attain recovery of the economy. An AEI staff member said that the Democrats in congress who opposed the Bush stimulus plan were foolish for doing so as he saw the plan as a major success for the administration.&#91;47&#93;<br/>Financial crisis of 2007&#8211;2008<br/>As the financial crisis of 2007&#8211;2008 unfolded, The Wall Street Journal stated that predictions by AEI staff about the involvement of housing GSEs had come true.&#91;48&#93; In the late 1990s, Fannie Mae eased credit requirements on the mortgages it purchased and exposed itself to more risk. Peter J. Wallison warned that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's public-private status put taxpayers on the line for increased risk.&#91;49&#93;<br/>\"Because of the agencies' dual public and private form, various efforts to force Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to fulfill their public mission at the cost of their profitability have failed&#8212;and will likely continue to fail\", he wrote in 2001. \"The only viable solution would seem to be full privatization or the adoption of policies that would force the agencies to adopt this course themselves.\"&#91;50&#93;<br/>Wallison ramped up his criticism of the GSEs throughout the 2000s. In 2006, and 2007, he moderated conferences featuring James B. Lockhart III, the chief regulator of Fannie and Freddie&#91;51&#93;<br/>In August 2008, after Fannie and Freddie had been backstopped by the US Treasury Department, Wallison outlined several ways of dealing with the GSEs, including \"nationalization through a receivership,\" outright \"privatization,\" and \"privatization through a receivership.\"&#91;52&#93; The following month, Lockhart and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson took the former path by putting Fannie and Freddie into federal \"conservatorship.\"&#91;53&#93;<br/>As the housing crisis unfolded, AEI sponsored a series of conferences featuring commentators including Desmond Lachman, and Nouriel Roubini.&#91;54&#93;&#91;55&#93;&#91;56&#93;&#91;57&#93;&#91;58&#93; Makin had been warning about the effects of a housing downturn on the broader economy for months.&#91;59&#93;<br/>Amid charges that many homebuyers did not understand their complex mortgages, Alex J. Pollock gained recognition for crafting a prototype of a one-page mortgage disclosure form.&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93;<br/>Research in AEI's Financial Markets Program also includes banking, insurance and securities regulation, accounting reform, corporate governance, and consumer finance.&#91;62&#93;<br/>Tax and fiscal policy<br/>Kevin Hassett and Alan D. Viard are AEI's principal tax policy experts, although Alex Brill, R. Glenn Hubbard, and Aparna Mathur also work on the subject. Specific subjects include \"income distribution, transition costs, marginal tax rates, and international taxation of corporate income... the Pension Protection Act of 2006; dynamic scoring and the effects of taxation on investment, savings, and entrepreneurial activity; and options to fix the alternative minimum tax\".&#91;63&#93; Hassett has coedited several volumes on tax reform.&#91;64&#93;<br/>Viard edited a book on tax policy lessons from the Bush administration.&#91;65&#93; AEI's working paper series includes developing academic works on economic issues. One paper by Hassett and Mathur on the responsiveness of wages to corporate taxation&#91;66&#93; was cited by The Economist;&#91;67&#93; figures from another paper by Hassett and Brill on maximizing corporate income tax revenue&#91;68&#93; was cited by The Wall Street Journal.&#91;69&#93;<br/>Center for Regulatory and Market Studies<br/>From 1998 to 2008, the Reg-Markets Center was the AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies, directed by Robert W. Hahn. The Center, which no longer exists, sponsored conferences, papers, and books on regulatory decision-making and the impact of federal regulation on consumers, businesses, and governments. It covered a range of disciplines. It also sponsored an annual Distinguished Lecture series. Past lecturers in the series have included William Baumol, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, Alfred Kahn, Sam Peltzman, Richard Posner, and Cass Sunstein.&#91;70&#93;<br/>Energy and environmental policy<br/>AEI's work on climate change has been subject to controversy (see below). According to AEI, it \"emphasizes the need to design environmental policies that protect not only nature but also democratic institutions and human liberty\".&#91;63&#93; When the Kyoto Protocol was approaching, AEI was hesitant to encourage the U.S. to join. In an essay from the AEI outlook series of 2007, the authors discuss the Kyoto Protocol and state that the United States \"should be wary of joining an international emissions-trading regime\". To back this statement, they point out that committing to the Kyoto emissions goal would be a significant and unrealistic obligation for the United States. In addition, they state that the Kyoto regulations would have an impact not only on governmental policies, but also the private sector through expanding government control over investment decisions. AEI staff said that \"dilution of sovereignty\" would be the result if the U.S. signed the treaty.&#91;71&#93;<br/>AEI has promoted carbon taxation as an alternative to cap-and-trade regimes. \"Most economists believe a carbon tax (a tax on the quantity of CO2 emitted when using energy) would be a superior policy alternative to an emissions-trading regime,\" wrote Kenneth P. Green, Kevin Hassett, and Steven F. Hayward. \"In fact, the irony is that there is a broad consensus in favor of a carbon tax everywhere except on Capitol Hill, where the 'T word' is anathema.\"&#91;72&#93;<br/>Other AEI staff have argued for similar policies.&#91;73&#93;&#91;74&#93; Thernstrom and Lane are codirecting a project on whether geoengineering would be a feasible way to \"buy us time to make &#91;the&#93; transition &#91;from fossil fuels&#93; while protecting us from the worst potential effects of warming\".&#91;75&#93;<br/>Green, who departed AEI in 2013, expanded its work on energy policy. He has hosted conferences on nuclear power&#91;76&#93; and ethanol&#91;77&#93;&#91;78&#93; With Aparna Mathur, he evaluated Americans' indirect energy use to discover unexpected areas in which energy efficiencies can be achieved.&#91;79&#93;&#91;80&#93;<br/>Foreign and defense policy studies<br/>AEI's foreign and defense policy studies researchers focus on \"how political and economic freedom&#8212;as well as American interests&#8212;are best promoted around the world\".&#91;40&#93; AEI staff have tended to be advocates of a hard U.S. line on threats or potential threats to the United States, including the Soviet Union during the Cold War, Saddam Hussein's Iraq, the People's Republic of China, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Russia, and terrorist or militant groups like al Qaeda and Hezbollah. Likewise, AEI staff have promoted closer U.S. ties with countries whose interests or values they view as aligned with America's, such as Israel, the Republic of China (Taiwan), India, Australia, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and emerging post-Communist states such as Poland and Georgia.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>AEI's foreign and defense policy studies department, directed by Danielle Pletka, is the part of the institute most commonly associated with neoconservatism,&#91;4&#93; especially by its critics.&#91;81&#93;&#91;82&#93; Prominent foreign-policy neoconservatives at AEI include Richard Perle, Gary Schmitt, and Paul Wolfowitz. John Bolton, often said to be a neoconservative,&#91;83&#93;&#91;84&#93; has said he is not one, as his primary focus is on American interests, not democracy promotion.&#91;85&#93;&#91;86&#93; Joshua Muravchik and Michael Ledeen spent many years at AEI, although they departed at around the same time as Reuel Marc Gerecht in 2008 in what was rumored to be a \"purge\" of neoconservatives at the institute, possibly \"signal&#91;ing&#93; the end of &#91;neoconservatism's&#93; domination over the think tank over the past several decades\",&#91;87&#93; although Muravchik later said it was the result of personality and management conflicts.&#91;88&#93;<br/>U.S. national security strategy, defense policy, and the \"surge\"<br/>In late 2006, the security situation in Iraq continued to deteriorate, and the Iraq Study Group proposed a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops and further engagement of Iraq's neighbors. Consulting with AEI's Iraq Planning Group, Frederick W. Kagan published an AEI report entitled Choosing Victory: A Plan for Success in Iraq calling for \"phase one\" of a change in strategy to focus on \"clearing and holding\" neighborhoods and securing the population; a troop escalation of seven Army brigades and Marine regiments; and a renewed emphasis on reconstruction, economic development, and jobs.&#91;39&#93;<br/>While the report was being drafted, Kagan and Keane were briefing President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and other senior Bush administration officials behind the scenes. According to Bob Woodward, \"&#91;Peter J.&#93; Schoomaker was outraged when he saw news coverage that retired Gen. Jack Keane, the former Army vice chief of staff, had briefed the president on December 11 about a new Iraq strategy being proposed by the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative think tank. 'When does AEI start trumping the Joint Chiefs of Staff on this stuff?' Schoomaker asked at the next chiefs' meeting.\"&#91;89&#93;<br/>Kagan, Keane, and Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman presented the plan at a January 5, 2007, event at AEI. Bush announced the change of strategy on January 10 the idea having \"won additional support among some officials as a result of a detailed study by Gen. Jack Keane, the former vice chief of staff at the Army, and Frederick W. Kagan, a military specialist, that was published by the American Enterprise Institute\".&#91;38&#93; Kagan authored three subsequent reports monitoring the progress of the surge.&#91;90&#93;<br/>AEI's defense policy researchers, who also include Schmitt and Thomas Donnelly, also work on issues related to the U.S. military forces' size and structure and military partnerships with allies (both bilaterally and through institutions such as NATO). Schmitt directs AEI's Program on Advanced Strategic Studies, which \"analyzes the long-term issues that will impact America's security and its ability to lead internationally\".&#91;63&#93;<br/>Area studies<br/>Asian studies at AEI covers \"the rise of China as an economic and political power; Taiwan's security and economic agenda; Japan's military transformation; the threat of a nuclear North Korea; and the impact of regional alliances and rivalries on U.S. military and economic relationships in Asia\".&#91;63&#93; AEI has published several reports on Asia.&#91;91&#93;<br/>Papers in AEI's Tocqueville on China Project series \"elicit the underlying civic culture of post-Mao China, enabling policymakers to better understand the internal forces and pressures that are shaping China's future\".&#91;92&#93;<br/>AEI's Europe program was previously housed under the auspices of the New Atlantic Initiative, which was directed by Radek Sikorski before his return to Polish politics in 2005. Leon Aron's work forms the core of the institute's program on Russia. AEI staff tend to view Russia as posing \"strategic challenges for the West\".&#91;63&#93;<br/>Mark Falcoff, now retired, was previously AEI's resident Latinamericanist, focusing on the Southern Cone, Panama, and Cuba. He has warned that the road for Cuba after Fidel Castro's rule or the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo would be difficult for an island scarred by a half-century of poverty and civil turmoil.&#91;93&#93; Roger Noriega's focuses at AEI are on Venezuela, Brazil, the M&#233;rida Initiative with Mexico and Central America,&#91;94&#93; and hemispheric relations.<br/>AEI has historically devoted significant attention to the Middle East, especially through the work of former resident scholars Ledeen and Muravchik. Pletka's research focus also includes the Middle East, and she coordinated a conference series on empowering democratic dissidents and advocates in the Arab World.&#91;95&#93; In 2009, AEI launched the Critical Threats Project, led by Kagan, to \"highlight the complexity of the global challenges the United States faces with a primary focus on Iran and al Qaeda's global influence\".&#91;63&#93; The project includes IranTracker.org,&#91;96&#93; with contributions from Ali Alfoneh, Ahmad Majidyar and Michael Rubin, among others.<br/>International organizations and economic development<br/>For several years, AEI and the Federalist Society cosponsored NGOWatch, which was later subsumed into Global Governance Watch, \"a web-based resource that addresses issues of transparency and accountability in the United Nations, NGOs, and related international organizations\".&#91;63&#93; NGOWatch returned as a subsite of Global Governance Watch, led by Jon Entine. AEI scholars focusing on international organizations includes John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,&#91;97&#93; and John Yoo, who researches international law and sovereignty.&#91;63&#93;<br/>AEI's research on economic development dates back to the early days of the institute. P. T. Bauer authored a monograph on development in India in 1959,&#91;98&#93; and Edward Banfield published a booklet on the theory behind foreign aid in 1970.&#91;99&#93; Since 2001, AEI has sponsored the Henry Wendt Lecture in International Development, named for Henry Wendt, an AEI trustee emeritus and former CEO of SmithKline Beckman.&#91;100&#93; Notable lecturers have included Angus Maddison and Deepak Lal.<br/>Nicholas Eberstadt holds the Henry Wendt Chair, focusing on demographics, population growth and human capital development; he served on the federal HELP Commission.<br/>Paul Wolfowitz, the former president of the World Bank, researches development policy in Africa.<br/>Roger Bate focuses his research on malaria, HIV/AIDS, counterfeit and substandard drugs,&#91;101&#93; access to water,&#91;102&#93; and other problems endemic in the developing world.<br/>Health policy studies<br/>AEI scholars have engaged in health policy research since the institute's early days. A Center for Health Policy Research was established in 1974.&#91;103&#93; For many years, Robert B. Helms led the health department. AEI's long-term focuses in health care have included national insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, pharmaceutical innovation, health care competition, and cost control.&#91;63&#93;<br/>The Center was replaced in the mid-1980s with the Health Policy Studies Program, which continues to this day. The AEI Press has published dozens of books on health policy since the 1970s. Since 2003, AEI has published the Health Policy Outlook series on new developments in U.S. and international health policy. AEI also published \"A Better Prescription\" to outline their ideal plan to healthcare reform. In the report, a great amount of emphasis is placed on placing the money and control in the hands of the consumers and continuing the market-based system of healthcare. They also acknowledge that this form of healthcare \"relies on financial incentives rather than central direction and control, and it recognizes that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work in a country as diverse as ours\".&#91;47&#93;<br/>In 2009, AEI researchers were active in assessing the Obama administration's health care proposals.&#91;104&#93;&#91;105&#93;<br/>Paul Ryan, then-minority point man for health care in the House of Representatives, delivered the keynote address at an AEI conference on five key elements of health reform: mandated universal coverage, insurance exchanges, the public plan option, medical practice and treatment, and revenue to cover federal health care costs.&#91;106&#93;<br/>AEI scholars have long argued against the tax break for employer-sponsored health insurance, arguing that it distorts insurance markets and limits consumer choices.&#91;107&#93;&#91;108&#93;&#91;109&#93;&#91;110&#93;<br/>In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, John McCain advocated this plan while Barack Obama disparaged it; in 2009, however, members of the Obama administration indicated that lifting the exemption was \"on the table.\"&#91;111&#93; Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a medical doctor, has expressed concern about relatively unreliable comparative effectiveness research being used to restrict treatment options under a public plan.&#91;112&#93; AEI publishes a series of monographs on Medicare reform, edited by Helms and Antos.&#91;113&#93;<br/>Roger Bate's work includes international health policy, especially pharmaceutical quality, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and multilateral health organizations. In 2008, Dora Akunyili, then Nigeria's top drug safety official, spoke at an AEI event coinciding with the launch of Bate's book Making a Killing.&#91;101&#93;&#91;114&#93; After undergoing a kidney transplant in 2006,&#91;115&#93; Sally Satel expanded her work from drug addiction treatment and mental health to include studies of compensation systems that she argues would increase the supply of organs for transplant.&#91;116&#93; In addition to their work on pharmaceutical innovation and FDA regulation, Gottlieb and John E. Calfee have examined vaccine and antiviral drug supplies in the wake of the 2009 flu pandemic.&#91;117&#93;<br/>Legal and constitutional studies<br/>The AEI Legal Center for the Public Interest, formed in 2007 from the merger of the National Legal Center for the Public Interest, houses all legal and constitutional research at AEI. Legal studies have a long pedigree at AEI; the institute was in the vanguard of the law and economics movement in the 1970s and 1980s with the publication of Regulation magazine and AEI Press books. Robert Bork published The Antitrust Paradox with AEI support.&#91;118&#93; Other jurists, legal scholars, and constitutional scholars who have conducted research at AEI include Walter Berns, Richard Epstein, Bruce Fein, Robert Goldwin, Antonin Scalia, and Laurence Silberman. Goldwin, assisted by Art Kaufman, William Schambra, and Robert A. Licht, edited the ten-volume \"A Decade of Study of the Constitution\" series from 1980 -90.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>The AEI Legal Center sponsors the annual Gauer Distinguished Lecture in Law and Public Policy. Past lecturers include Stephen Breyer, George H. W. Bush, Christopher Cox, Douglas Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor, Colin Powell, Ronald Reagan, William Rehnquist, Condoleezza Rice, Margaret Thatcher, and William H. Webster.&#91;119&#93;<br/>Ted Frank, the director of the AEI Legal Center, focuses on liability law and tort reform.&#91;120&#93; Michael S. Greve focuses on constitutional law and federalism, including federal preemption.&#91;121&#93; Greve is a fixture in the conservative legal movement. According to Jonathan Rauch, in 2005, Greve convened \"a handful of free-market activists and litigators met in a windowless 11th-floor conference room at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington\" in opposition to the legality of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. \"By the time the meeting finished, the participants had decided to join forces and file suit... . No one paid much attention. But the yawning stopped on May 18, &#91;2009,&#93; when the Supreme Court announced it will hear the case.\"&#91;122&#93;<br/>Political and public opinion studies<br/>AEI's \"Political Corner\"&#91;123&#93; includes a range of political viewpoints, from the center-left&#91;124&#93;&#91;125&#93; Norman J. Ornstein to the conservative Michael Barone. The Political Corner sponsors the biannual Election Watch series,&#91;126&#93; the \"longest-running election program in Washington\", featuring Barone, Ornstein, Karlyn Bowman, and &#8212; formerly &#8212; Ben Wattenberg and Bill Schneider, among others.&#91;40&#93; Ornstein and Fortier (an expert on absentee and early voting&#91;127&#93;) collaborate on a number of election- and governance-related projects, including the Election Reform Project&#91;128&#93; and the Continuity of Government Commission,&#91;citation needed&#93; also jointly sponsored by AEI and Brookings, with Jimmy Carter and Alan Simpson as honorary co-chairmen. AEI and Brookings are sponsoring a project on election demographics called \"The Future of Red, Blue, and Purple America\", co-directed by Bowman and Ruy Teixeira.&#91;129&#93;<br/>AEI's work on political processes and institutions has been a central part of the institute's research programs since the 1970s. The AEI Press published a series of several dozen volumes in the 1970s and 1980s called \"At the Polls\"; in each volume, scholars would assess a country's recent presidential or parliamentary election. AEI scholars have been called upon to observe and assess constitutional conventions and elections worldwide. In the early 1980s, AEI scholars were commissioned by the U.S. government to monitor plebiscites in Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands.&#91;130&#93;<br/>Another landmark in AEI's political studies is After the People Vote.&#91;131&#93; AEI's work on election reform continued into the 1990s and 2000s; Ornstein led a working group that drafted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002.&#91;132&#93;&#91;133&#93;<br/>AEI published Public Opinion magazine from 1978-90 under the editorship of Seymour Martin Lipset and Ben Wattenberg, assisted by Karlyn Bowman. The institute's work on polling continues with public opinion features in The American Enterprise and The American and Bowman's AEI Studies in Public Opinion.&#91;134&#93;<br/>Social and cultural studies<br/>AEI's social and cultural studies program dates to the 1970s, when William J. Baroody Sr., perceiving the importance of the philosophical and cultural underpinnings of modern economics and politics,&#91;135&#93; invited social and religious thinkers like Irving Kristol and Michael Novak to take up residence at AEI. Since then, AEI has sponsored research on a wide variety of issues, including education, religion, race and gender, and social welfare. AEI's previous president, Arthur C. Brooks, rose to prominence with survey analysis on philanthropy and happiness.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>Supported by the Bradley Foundation, AEI has hosted since 1989 the Bradley Lecture Series, \"which aims to enrich debate in the Washington policy community through exploration of the philosophical and historical underpinnings of current controversies\". Notable speakers in the series have included Kristol, Novak, Allan Bloom, Robert Bork, David Brooks, Lynne Cheney, Ron Chernow, Tyler Cowen, Niall Ferguson, Francis Fukuyama, Eugene Genovese, Robert P. George, Gertrude Himmelfarb, Samuel P. Huntington (giving the first public presentation of his \"clash of civilizations\" theory in 1992), Paul Johnson, Leon Kass, Charles Krauthammer, Bernard Lewis, Seymour Martin Lipset, Harvey C. Mansfield, Michael Medved, Allan H. Meltzer, Edmund Morris, Charles Murray, Steven Pinker, Norman Podhoretz, Richard Posner, Jonathan Rauch, Andrew Sullivan, Cass Sunstein, Sam Tanenhaus, James Q. Wilson, John Yoo, and Fareed Zakaria.&#91;136&#93;<br/>Education<br/>Education policy studies at AEI are directed by Frederick M. Hess, who has authored, coauthored, or edited a number of volumes based on major conferences held at AEI on subjects like urban school reform,&#91;137&#93; school choice,&#91;138&#93; No Child Left Behind,&#91;139&#93; teacher qualification,&#91;140&#93; \"educational entrepreneurship,\"&#91;141&#93; student loans,&#91;142&#93; and education research.&#91;143&#93;<br/>Hess co-directs AEI's Future of American Education Project, whose working group includes Washington, D.C. schools chancellor Michelle Rhee and Michael Feinberg, the cofounder of KIPP. Hess works closely with Rhee:&#91;144&#93; she has spoken at AEI on several occasions and appointed Hess to be one of two independent reform evaluators for the District of Columbia Public Schools. Hess coauthored Diplomas and Dropouts,&#91;145&#93; a report on university graduation rates that was widely publicized in 2009.&#91;146&#93; The report, along with other education-related projects, was supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.&#91;147&#93;&#91;148&#93;<br/>AEI is often identified as a supporter of vouchers,&#91;149&#93; but Hess has been critical of school vouchers: \"&#91;I&#93;t is by now clear that aggressive reforms to bring market principles to American education have failed to live up to their billing. ... In the school choice debate, many reformers have gotten so invested in the language of 'choice' that they seem to forget choice is only half of the market equation. Markets are about both supply and demand&#8212;and, while 'choice' is concerned with emboldening consumer demand, the real action when it comes to prosperity, productivity, and progress is typically on the supply side.\"&#91;150&#93;<br/>Funding<br/>AEI's revenues for the fiscal year ending June 2015 were $84,616,388 against expenses of $38,611,315.&#91;151&#93; In 2014, the charity evaluating service American Institute of Philanthropy gave AEI an \"A-\" grade in its CharityWatch \"Top-Rated Charities\" listing.&#91;152&#93;<br/>As of 2005 AEI had received $960,000 from ExxonMobil.&#91;153&#93; In 2010, AEI received a US$2.5 million grant from the Donors Capital Fund, a donor-advised fund.&#91;154&#93;<br/>A 2013 study by Drexel University Sociologist Robert J. Brulle noted that AEI received $86.7 million dollars between 2003 and 2010.&#91;155&#93;<br/>Controversies<br/>Goldwater campaign<br/>In 1964, William J. Baroody Sr., and several of his top staff at AEI, including Karl Hess, moonlighted as policy advisers and speechwriters for Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater. \"Even though Baroody and his staff sought to support Goldwater on their own time&#8212;without using the institution's resources&#8212;AEI came under close scrutiny from the IRS in the years following the campaign,\" Andrew Rich writes.&#91;156&#93; Representative Wright Patman subpoenaed the institute's tax papers, and the IRS investigated for two years.&#91;157&#93; After this, AEI's officers scrupulously attempted to avoid even the appearance of political advocacy.&#91;156&#93;<br/>Global warming<br/>Some AEI staff and fellows have been critical of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the international scientific body tasked to evaluate the risk of climate change caused by human activity.&#91;158&#93;&#91;159&#93;<br/>In February 2007, a number of sources, including the British newspaper The Guardian, reported that the AEI had sent letters to scientists offering $10,000 plus travel expenses and additional payments, asking them to critique the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.&#91;160&#93; This offer was criticized as bribery.&#91;161&#93;&#91;162&#93; The letters alleged that the IPCC was \"resistant to reasonable criticism and dissent, and prone to summary conclusions that are poorly supported by the analytical work\" and asked for essays that \"thoughtfully explore the limitations of climate model outputs\".&#91;163&#93;&#91;164&#93;<br/>The Guardian reported that the AEI received $1.6 million in funding from ExxonMobil, and further notes that former ExxonMobil CEO Lee R. Raymond is the vice-chairman of AEI's board of trustees.&#91;165&#93; This story was repeated by Newsweek, which drew criticism from its contributing editor Robert J. Samuelson because \"this accusation was long ago discredited, and Newsweek shouldn't have lent it respectability.\"&#91;166&#93; The Guardian article was disputed both by AEI&#91;167&#93; and in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal.&#91;168&#93; The rebuttals claimed factual errors and distortions, noting the ExxonMobil funding was spread out over a ten-year period and totaled less than 1% of AEI's budget. The Wall Street Journal editorial stated: \"AEI doesn't lobby, didn't offer money to scientists to question global warming, and the money it did pay for climate research didn't come from Exxon.\"&#91;169&#93;<br/>AEI denies that the organization is skeptical about global warming. Criticizing the story as part of a \"climate inquisition\" published in \"the left-wing press\", the AEI's Steven Hayward and Kenneth Green wrote in The Weekly Standard:<br/>&#91;I&#93;t has never been true that we ignore mainstream science; and anyone who reads AEI publications closely can see that we are not \"skeptics\" about warming. It is possible to accept the general consensus about the existence of global warming while having valid questions about the extent of warming, the consequences of warming, and the appropriate responses. In particular, one can remain a policy skeptic, which is where we are today, along with nearly all economists.&#91;170&#93;<br/>Statements by affiliated people<br/>Former scholar Steven Hayward has described efforts to reduce global warming as being \"based on exaggerations and conjecture rather than science\".&#91;171&#93; He has stated that \"even though the leading scientific journals are thoroughly imbued with environmental correctness and reject out of hand many articles that don't conform to the party line, a study that confounds the conventional wisdom is published almost every week\".&#91;172&#93;<br/>About<br/>The American Enterprise Institute is a public policy think tank dedicated to defending human dignity, expanding human potential, and building a freer and safer world. The work of our scholars and staff advances ideas rooted in our belief in democracy, free enterprise, American strength and global leadership, solidarity with those at the periphery of our society, and a pluralistic, entrepreneurial culture.<br/>#######<br/><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enterprise_Institute\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enterprise_Institute</a><br/>Likewise, former AEI scholar Kenneth Green has referred to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as \"the positively silly idea of establishing global-weather control by actively managing the atmosphere's greenhouse-gas emissions\", and endorsed Michael Crichton's novel State of Fear for having \"educated millions of readers about climate science\".&#91;173&#93;<br/>Christopher DeMuth, former AEI president, accepted that the earth has warmed in recent decades, but he stated that \"it's not clear why this happened\" and charged as well that the IPCC \"has tended to ignore many distinguished physicists and meteorologists whose work casts doubt on the influence of greenhouse gases on global temperature trends\".&#91;174&#93; Fellow James Glassman also disputes the prevailing scientific opinion on climate change, having written numerous articles criticizing the Kyoto accords and climate science more generally for Tech Central Station.&#91;175&#93; He supported the views of U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK), who claims that \"global warming is 'the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people,'\"&#91;176&#93; and, like Green, cites Crichton's novel State of Fear, which \"casts serious doubt on global warming and extremists who espouse it\".&#91;177&#93;<br/>Joel Schwartz, an AEI visiting fellow, stated: \"The Earth has indeed warmed during the last few decades and may warm further in the future. But the pattern of climate change is not consistent with the greenhouse effect being the main cause.\"&#91;178&#93;<br/>After Energy Secretary Steven Chu recommended painting roofs and roads white in order to reflect sunlight back into space and therefore reduce global warming, AEI's magazine The American endorsed the idea. It also stated that \"ultimately we need to look more broadly at creative ways of reducing the harmful effects of climate change in the long run.\"&#91;179&#93; The American's editor-in-chief and fellow Nick Schulz endorsed a carbon tax over a cap and trade program in The Christian Science Monitor on February 13, 2009. He stated that it \"would create a market price for carbon emissions and lead to emissions reductions or new technologies that cut greenhouse gases.\"&#91;180&#93;<br/>In October 2007, resident scholar and executive director of the AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies Robert W. Hahn commented:<br/>Fending off both sincere and sophistic opposition to cap-and-trade will no doubt require some uncomfortable compromises. Money will be wasted on unpromising R&D; grotesquely expensive renewable fuels may gain a permanent place at the subsidy trough. And, as noted above, there will always be a risk of cheating. But the first priority should be to seize the day, putting a domestic emissions regulation system in place. Without America's political leadership and economic muscle behind it, an effective global climate stabilization strategy isn't possible.&#91;181&#93;<br/>AEI visiting scholar N. Gregory Mankiw wrote in The New York Times in support of a carbon tax on September 16, 2007. He remarked that \"there is a broad consensus. The scientists tell us that world temperatures are rising because humans are emitting carbon into the atmosphere. Basic economics tells us that when you tax something, you normally get less of it.\"&#91;182&#93;<br/>Termination of David Frum's residency<br/>On March 25, 2010, AEI resident fellow David Frum announced that his position at the organization had been \"terminated.\"&#91;183&#93;&#91;184&#93; Following this announcement, media outlets speculated that Frum had been \"forced out\"&#91;185&#93;&#91;186&#93;&#91;187&#93; for writing a post to his FrumForum blog called \"Waterloo\", in which he criticized the Republican Party's unwillingness to bargain with Democrats on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In the editorial, Frum claimed that his party's failure to reach a deal \"led us to abject and irreversible defeat.\"&#91;188&#93;<br/>After his termination, Frum clarified that his article had been \"welcomed and celebrated\" by AEI President Arthur Brooks, and that he had been asked to leave because \"these are hard times.\" Brooks had offered Frum the opportunity to write for AEI on a nonsalaried basis, but Frum declined.&#91;185&#93; The following day, journalist Mike Allen published a conversation with Frum, in which Frum expressed a belief that his termination was the result of pressure from donors. According to Frum, \"AEI represents the best of the conservative world...But the elite isn't leading anymore...I think Arthur &#91;Brooks&#93; took no pleasure in this. I think he was embarrassed.\"&#91;189&#93;<br/>See also<br/>List of American Enterprise Institute scholars and fellows<br/>Francis Boyer Award<br/>Irving Kristol Award"},{"id":155,"title":"COVAX","group":"Organization","image":"img/COVAX.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVAX\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVAX</a><br/>COVAX<br/>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>Jump to navigationJump to search<br/>Not to be confused with Covaxin.<br/>COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access, abbreviated as COVAX, is a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines directed by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, or GAVI), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the World Health Organization (WHO). It is one of the three pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, an initiative begun in April 2020 by the WHO, the European Commission, and the government of France as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVAX coordinates international resources to enable low-to-middle-income countries equitable access to COVID-19 tests, therapies, and vaccines.&#91;1&#93; By 15 July 2020, 165 countries &#8211; representing 60% of the human population &#8211; had joined COVAX.&#91;2&#93;<br/>However, COVAX is falling short of its goal. Despite a goal of delivering 100 million doses by the end of March 2021, as of 11 April it had delivered only 38.5 million,&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93; and as of 17 June it had delivered only 88 million.&#91;5&#93;<br/>Contents<br/>1&#9;Vaccine candidates<br/>2&#9;Distribution (recipients)<br/>3&#9;Participants (donors)<br/>3.1&#9;Canada<br/>3.2&#9;China<br/>3.3&#9;India<br/>3.4&#9;European Union<br/>3.5&#9;United Kingdom<br/>3.6&#9;United States<br/>3.7&#9;United Arab Emirates<br/>3.8&#9;Private donors<br/>4&#9;See also<br/>5&#9;References<br/>6&#9;External links<br/>Vaccine candidates<br/>As of June 2021, the WHO has approved Oxford&#8211;AstraZeneca, Pfizer&#8211;BioNTech, Moderna, Sinopharm, Sinovac and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for emergency use.&#91;6&#93; These vaccines can be distributed as part of COVAX.&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93;<br/>Many of the countries that will benefit from COVAX have \"limited regulatory capacity\" and depend on WHO's authorisations. By early 2021, WHO was reviewing 11 potential COVID-19 vaccines for its Emergency Use Listing (EUL).&#91;9&#93; The first vaccine WHO authorised for its EUL on 31 December 2020 was the Pfizer&#8211;BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine&#8212;an RNA vaccine developed by BioNTech in cooperation with the American company Pfizer sold under the brand name Comirnaty.&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93;<br/>The WHO stated in a press release on 24 August 2020 that COVAX had nine CEPI-supported vaccine candidates and nine candidates undergoing trials, giving it the largest selection of COVID-19 vaccinations in the world.&#91;13&#93; By December 2020, COVAX had finalized negotiations with other manufacturers that gave it access to two billion vaccine doses.&#91;14&#93;<br/>Distribution (recipients)<br/>Involvement by country<br/>  AMC donor<br/>  Member of the European Union (AMC donor)<br/>  Self-financing participant<br/>  Self-financing participant and AMC donor<br/>  AMC recipient<br/>  AMC recipient and donor<br/>  Not involved<br/>COVAX provides vaccines to the developing world.&#91;15&#93; A total of 92 low- and middle-income countries are eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX mechanism&#91;16&#93; through the COVAX Vaccines Advance Market Commitment (AMC) financing instrument.&#91;16&#93;&#91;17&#93; COVAX AMC is funded by donor contributions.&#91;17&#93; COVAX AMC funds the COVAX Facility, the vaccine procurement platform.&#91;17&#93;<br/>On 3 February 2021, GAVI, the WHO, and UNICEF published the country-by-country distribution of the Pfizer&#8211;BioNTech and Oxford&#8211;AstraZeneca vaccines forecast for first half of 2021.&#91;18&#93; The early projection includes 336 million doses of the Oxford&#8211;AstraZeneca vaccine as well as 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer&#8211;BioNTech vaccine to the 145 COVAX facility participants.&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93; It is expected that health care workers and the most vulnerable will receive the first doses, which are anticipated to reach approximately 3.3% of the total population of each participating country by the end of the first half of 2021.&#91;20&#93;<br/>In February 2021, the WHO and Chubb Limited announced the roll out of a no-fault compensation scheme for COVID-19 vaccinations for low and middle-income countries which would be financed initially through Gavi COVAX AMC donor funding.&#91;21&#93;<br/>On 24 February 2021, Ghana became the first country in the world to receive vaccines through COVAX when 600,000 doses of the Oxford&#8211;AstraZeneca vaccine were delivered to Accra.&#91;15&#93;&#91;22&#93; On the 2nd of March, COVID-19 vaccines were being distributed in Ghana by Zipline drones&#91;23&#93;This method allows to reach remote areas (which are underserved by traditional logistics).&#91;24&#93;<br/>On 1 March 2021, frontline workers and public officials from the Ivory Coast became the first persons to be inoculated with COVID-19 vaccines shipped from the COVAX Facility. More than 500,000 doses of the Oxford&#8211;AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India were shipped to the city of Abidjan the week before. The vaccines were flown in by UNICEF from Mumbai.&#91;25&#93;<br/>On 5 March 2021, Moldova received 14,400 Oxford&#8211;AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine units through COVAX, becoming the first European country to do so. The country had already been donated 21,600 doses of the same vaccine by Romania some days earlier.&#91;26&#93;<br/>On 25 March 2021, Bosnia and Herzegovina received 24,300 Pfizer&#8211;BioNTech and 26,400 Oxford&#8211;AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine units through COVAX, becoming the second European country to do so.&#91;27&#93; The country had already been, in total, donated over 20,000 doses of the Oxford&#8211;AstraZeneca vaccine by Serbia and Slovenia some weeks earlier.&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93;<br/>On 8 June 2021, Uruguay released health data from their vaccination efforts through the COVAX program. Almost 800,000 individuals or 52% of the adult population received two doses of the Coronavac or Pfizer vaccines. The government also studied the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine among 162,047 health workers and people over 80 years old. Both vaccine types reduced hospitalisations and deaths by over 90%, and infection rates by more than 60%. Because of accessible healthcare and available COVAX vaccine supplies, the small Latin nation was able to ward off a serious COVID-19 spike in May 2021.&#91;30&#93;<br/>Interim Distribution Forecast as of 3 February 2021 (doses)&#91;20&#93;<br/>AMC: Advance Market Commitment; SFP: Self-Financing Participants<br/>Participant&#9;SFP/AMC&#9;AstraZeneca<br/>SII&#9;AstraZeneca<br/>SK Bioscience&#9;Pfizer&#8211;BioNTech&#9;Total<br/> India&#9;AMC&#9;97,164,000&#9;-&#9;-&#9;97,164,000<br/> Pakistan&#9;AMC&#9;17,160,000&#9;-&#9;-&#9;17,160,000<br/> Nigeria&#9;AMC&#9;16,008,000&#9;-&#9;-&#9;16,008,000<br/> Indonesia&#9;AMC&#9;-&#9;13,708,800&#9;-&#9;13,708,800<br/> Bangladesh&#9;AMC&#9;12,792,000&#9;-&#9;-&#9;12,792,000<br/> Brazil&#9;SFP&#9;-&#9;10,672,800&#9;-&#9;10,672,800<br/> Ethiopia&#9;AMC&#9;8,928,000&#9;-&#9;-&#9;8,928,000<br/> Congo, Dem.

Although more than $6 billion was pledged, not all of the funding has been delivered yet. In April, the initiative wrote that it had not yet received its target of $3.2 billion for 2021.&#91;31&#93;<br/>Although mainly funded by governments (\"Official Development Assistance\"), the COVAX scheme is also funded by private-sector and philanthropic contributions, and recipient countries may share some costs for vaccines and delivery.&#91;17&#93;<br/>In May 2021, UNICEF made an urgent appeal to industrialised nations to pool their excess COVID-19 vaccine capacity to make up for a 125-million-dose gap in the COVAX program. Only a limited amount of vaccines are distributed efficiently, and the shortfall of vaccines in South America and parts of Asia are due to a lack of expedient donations by richer nations. International organisations have pointed at Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Maldives as well as Argentina and Brazil, and some parts of the Caribbean as problem areas, where vaccines are in short supply. UNICEF has also been critical towards proposed donations of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines since these are not slated for delivery until the second half of 2021, or early 2022.&#91;32&#93;<br/>COVAX-AMC donors as of 23 June 2021&#91;33&#93;vte<br/>(million USD)<br/>Donor&#9;Contributions<br/> United States&#9;3,500<br/> Germany&#9;1,097<br/> Japan&#9;1,000<br/> United Kingdom&#9;733<br/>European Commission&#9;489<br/> Italy&#9;470<br/> Canada&#9;384<br/> Sweden&#9;296<br/> France&#9;244<br/>Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation&#9;206<br/>  Switzerland&#9;162<br/> Saudi Arabia&#9;153<br/> Norway&#9;141<br/> Spain&#9;122<br/> South Korea&#9;110<br/> Australia&#9;100<br/> Netherlands&#9;85<br/> Kuwait&#9;50<br/>Anonymous Swiss Foundation&#9;40<br/>Mastercard&#9;32<br/>Reed Hastings and Patty Quillin&#9;30<br/>KS Relief / Gamers Without Borders&#9;26<br/>Gates Philanthropy Partners&#9;18<br/> Denmark&#9;16<br/> Finland&#9;15<br/> New Zealand&#9;12<br/> Qatar&#9;10<br/>Shell&#9;10<br/>Twilio&#9;10<br/> Iceland&#9;6<br/> Austria&#9;6<br/>WHO Foundation-Go Give One Campaign&#9;6<br/> Singapore&#9;5<br/> Belgium&#9;5<br/> Ireland&#9;5<br/>Cisco&#9;5<br/>Google.org&#9;5<br/>Procter & Gamble&#9;5<br/>TikTok&#9;5<br/>TransferWise&#9;5<br/>Visa Foundation&#9;5<br/>Soccer Aid&#9;4<br/>Thistledown Foundation&#9;4<br/>Analog Devices Foundation&#9;3<br/> Greece&#9;2<br/> Luxembourg&#9;2<br/>Anonymous Donor&#9;2<br/>Asia Philanthropy Circle&#9;2<br/>Portuguese Private Sector&#9;2<br/>UBS Optimus Foundation&#9;2<br/>Vaccine Forward Initiative&#9;2<br/> The Philippines&#9;1.1<br/>Basque Government&#9;1<br/> Colombia&#9;1<br/> Oman&#9;1<br/> Croatia&#9;1<br/> Poland&#9;1<br/> Portugal&#9;1<br/> Vietnam&#9;1<br/>Coca-Cola Foundation&#9;1<br/>Salesforce&#9;1<br/>Seadream Family Foundation&#9;1<br/>Stanley Black & Decker&#9;1<br/>Spotify&#9;1<br/>Toyota Tsusho&#9;1<br/>Total&#9;9,661<br/>Canada<br/>Canada pledged $220 million worth of vaccines on September 25, 2020 to join as a self-financing contributor to COVAX. On June 14, Canada doubled its pledge to add an additional 13 million doses of Astra-Zeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and NovaVax vaccines. This was in addition to the over 80 million available to purchase through financial contribution.<br/>China<br/>China joined COVAX on 9 October 2020.&#91;34&#93; China said on 3 February 2021 that it will provide 10 million vaccine doses to COVAX.&#91;35&#93; BBIBP-CorV and CoronaVac are Chinese-developed vaccines approved by the WHO for distribution through COVAX.&#91;36&#93;<br/>India<br/>India joined COVAX through a membership with the GAVI alliance.&#91;37&#93; The Serum Institute of India is the main producer for the Oxford&#8211;AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (\"Covishield\"), and the principal source for the COVAX facility worldwide; up to 700 million doses were expected for 2021. After initial deliveries to North Africa, West Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East in March and April 2021, Indian officials have begun to limit \"Covishield\" exports until the end of 2021, due to high demand in their own country.&#91;38&#93;&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93; Based on the high infection rates in India, COVAX was projected to only deliver 145 million doses instead of 240 million by May 2021. Production of the vaccine was also negatively affected because of a ban by the U.S. on the export of key raw materials.&#91;41&#93;<br/>European Union<br/>As of November 2020, the European Union (EU) and EU members have pledged &#8364;870 million to COVAX.&#91;42&#93; The European Commission (EC) brought the EU into COVAX on 31 August 2020 and pledged &#8364;400 million in guarantees,&#91;43&#93; but did not state how this money would be paid out or its conditions.&#91;44&#93; The EC pledged a further &#8364;100 million from the 11th European Development Fund to COVAX via a grant to GAVI on 12 November.

ECFR builds coalitions for change at the European level and promotes informed debate about Europe's role in the world. ECFR has offices in Berlin, London, Madrid, Paris, Rome, Warsaw and Sofia.<br/>ECFR was founded in 2007 by Mark Leonard together with a council of fifty founding members, chaired by Martti Ahtisaari, Joschka Fischer, and Mabel van Oranje, with initial funding from George Soros&#8217;s Open Society Foundations, the Communitas Foundation, Sigrid Rausing, Unicredit and Fundaci&#243;n Para las Relaciones Internacionales y el Di&#225;logo Exterior (FRIDE).&#91;3&#93;<br/>ECFR's Council brings together over 300 Europeans from across Europe. Currently chaired by Carl Bildt, Lykke Friis and Norbert R&#246;ttgen, ECFR's strategic community includes serving foreign ministers, former prime ministers, members of national parliaments and European Parliament, EU Commissioners, former NATO secretaries generals, thinkers, journalists and business leaders.

When ECFR was founded in 2007, the Berlin, London, Madrid, Paris and Sofia offices were opened at the same time. The Rome office was opened in 2010; the Warsaw office in September 2011.<br/>Programmes, publications and events<br/>The think tank's research is broadly divided into four programmes. These are Asia & China, Wider Europe, European Power and Middle East & North Africa.&#91;4&#93; In addition, ECFR's fellows regularly publish policy papers on subjects that fall outside of these parameters. ECFR staff regularly publishes analysis and commentary in major European newspapers.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93; ECFR publishes individual policy reports, briefs, and memos, which are downloadable for free from ECFR's website. It has three regular publications, the annual European Foreign Policy Scorecard, that started in 2011;&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; China Analysis (quarterly) and an annual review of the EU and human rights at the UN. In addition to the regular publications, ECFR often has larger projects, which will include a set of publications on a given subject. ECFR's national offices hold regular events such as seminars, ginger groups and publication launches. Guest speakers at ECFR London's invitation-only &#8216;Black Coffee Mornings&#8217; have included Douglas Alexander, Louise Arbour, Joseph Nye, Pauline Neville-Jones, and George Robertson.&#91;11&#93;<br/>European Power<br/>The European Power programme was created in 2015 to help Europeans develop policy responses to the issues affecting the EU's capacity to act on the global scene. The programme explores the obstacles to sustainable unity on current and future foreign policy challenges and seeks to develop solutions for overcoming them. The programme is directed by Susi Dennison.<br/>Asia & China<br/>The Asia & China programme seeks to help Europe define a common strategic approach to China's rise. Its experts study Xi Jinping's leadership as well as co-operation, competition, and conflict between Beijing and its neighbours. The programme publishes China Analysis, a quarterly analytical survey of foreign policy news and debate within China, in conjunction with Asia Centre. The programme is directed by Fran&#231;ois Godement.<br/>Wider Europe<br/>ECFR believes that in order to remain relevant in the region, the European Union needs a coherent and consistent strategy to promote its interests and values together with the political will to follow this through. The Wider Europe programme was launched in 2007 with the aim of fostering this process. It is directed by Nicu Popescu.<br/>Middle East and North Africa<br/>The Middle East and North Africa programme follows political upheaval and sectarian conflict in the region, aiming to identify political solutions and help Europe develop coherent responses to North Africa's transitions and the Middle East peace process. The programme is directed by Julien Barnes-Dacey.<br/>ECFR's Council and Board<br/>ECFR's Council currently has over 300 members,&#91;12&#93; each serving a renewable three-year term. The membership includes former prime ministers, presidents, European commissioners, current and former parliamentarians and ministers, public intellectuals, business leaders, activists and cultural figures from the EU member states and candidate countries.&#91;13&#93;<br/>The Council is the strongest and most visible expression of ECFR's pan-European identity. Through their individual networks and collective engagement with ECFR policy and advocacy initiatives, Council Members help us ECFR to Europeanise the national conversations in the EU capitals on the EU's foreign policy priorities and challenges.<br/>The Council meets once a year as a full body to discuss how to advance its objectives. In addition, groups of council members form various geographical and thematic task forces, which provide ECFR staff with advice and feedback on policy ideas and assist with ECFR's activities within their own countries. The council is currently chaired by Carl Bildt (co-chair), Lykke Friis and Norbert R&#246;ttgen. The other members of the board are Ian Clarkson, Sylvie Kauffmann, Ivan Krastev, Andrzej Olechowski, Andrew Puddephatt, Javier Solana, and Helle Thorning-Schmidt.<br/>Funding<br/>ECFR is a private not-for-profit organization that relies on donations.&#91;14&#93; It was originally established with the support of Open Society Foundations, Communitas Foundation and Fundaci&#243;n Para las Relaciones Internacionales y el Di&#225;logo Exterior (FRIDE).<br/>About half of ECFR's funding comes from foundations, one third from governments and the rest from corporations and individuals.&#91;15&#93; Open Society Foundations is the main donor to ECFR, funding with its grants one third (&#163;2,345,566 in 2017) of ECFR's total income (&#163;7,278,122 in 2017).&#91;16&#93; Other donors include major organizations mainly from Europe and the Western world such as the foundation Stiftung Mercator &#91;de&#93; (&#163;710,753 or ~10% total funding in 2017), European and the Japanese governments, NATO, leading corporations such as Daimler AG and Microsoft as well as wealthy individuals.&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93;<br/>Communications<br/>ECFR regularly publishes comment and analysis pieces on foreign policy issues on its website. ECFR also publishes podcasts in English and German, and occasional podcasts in French, Italian and Spanish.&#91;19&#93; ECFR has a Twitter feed.&#91;20&#93;<br/>Awards and recognition<br/>ECFR was named \"Best New Think Tank in the World\" for 2009 and 2010 by the University of Pennsylvania's annual Global \"Go-To Think-Tanks\" report.&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;<br/>ECFR has received Prospect Magazine's \"Think Tank of the Year Awards\" in 2015 (EU International Affairs Think Tank of the Year),&#91;23&#93; 2014 (UK International Affairs Think Tank of the Year),&#91;24&#93; and 2010 (British-based think tank dealing with non-British affairs Think Tank of the Year).&#91;25&#93;<br/>In 2011, the academic responsible for compiling the University of Pennsylvania rankings, Dr James G. McGann, wrote in a book on global think tanks: &#8220;The fact that ECFR attempts to pursue policy advice and research through a pan-European focus means that it is free from the national restrictions of operating with one particular state framework in mind. In this sense, it is able to prescribe solutions and recommendations that benefit Europe as a whole and perhaps to a much greater extent than if they had done so with only, for example, the interests of Germany or France in mind. A framework that incorporates all the various workings and desires of each of the affected actors is far more likely to be successful from a long-term standpoint than one that attempts to resolve a regional or global issue by pushing for a solution that only benefits or alleviates the concerns of an individual state.&#8221;&#91;26&#93;<br/>See also"},{"id":161,"title":"Sylvia Mathews Burwell","group":"Person","image":"img/placeholder.png","value":1,"notes":""},{"id":162,"title":"Christopher Elias","group":"Person","image":"img/Christopher_Elias.png","value":1,"notes":""},{"id":163,"title":"One Young World","group":"Organization","image":"img/One_Young_World.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://www.oneyoungworld.com/\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.oneyoungworld.com/</a><br/>"},{"id":164,"title":"SEEK Development, Strategic and Organizational Consultants GmbH","group":"Company","image":"img/SEEK_Development,_Strategic_and_Organizational_Consultants_GmbH.png","value":1,"notes":"ABOUT US<br/>SEEK Development is a strategic and organizational consulting group dedicated to global human development and social impact.

The university is known for its strength in science and engineering, and is one among a small group of institutes of technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of pure and applied sciences.<br/>Caltech was founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891 and began attracting influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910 and the college assumed its present name in 1920. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von K&#225;rm&#225;n.&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;<br/>Caltech has six academic divisions with strong emphasis on science and engineering, managing $332 million in 2011 in sponsored research.&#91;10&#93; Its 124-acre (50 ha) primary campus is located approximately 11 mi (18 km) northeast of downtown Los Angeles. First-year students are required to live on campus, and 95% of undergraduates remain in the on-campus House System at Caltech. Although Caltech has a strong tradition of practical jokes and pranks,&#91;11&#93; student life is governed by an honor code which allows faculty to assign take-home examinations. The Caltech Beavers compete in 13 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division III's Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC).<br/>As of October 2020, there are 76 Nobel laureates who have been affiliated with Caltech, including 40 alumni and faculty members (41 prizes, with chemist Linus Pauling being the only individual in history to win two unshared prizes); in addition, 4 Fields Medalists and 6 Turing Award winners have been affiliated with Caltech. There are 8 Crafoord Laureates and 56 non-emeritus faculty members (as well as many emeritus faculty members) who have been elected to one of the United States National Academies, 4 Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force and 71 have won the United States National Medal of Science or Technology.&#91;4&#93; Numerous faculty members are associated with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as well as NASA.&#91;4&#93; According to a 2015 Pomona College study, Caltech ranked number one in the U.S. for the percentage of its graduates who go on to earn a PhD.&#91;12&#93;"},{"id":166,"title":"TED Foundation","group":"Organization","image":"img/placeholder.png","value":1,"notes":""},{"id":167,"title":"Harvard School of Public Health","group":"EducationInstitution","image":"img/Harvard_School_of_Public_Health.png","value":1,"notes":"<br/>"},{"id":168,"title":"IDEO ORG","group":"Organization","image":"img/IDEO_ORG.png","value":1,"notes":""},{"id":169,"title":"PEPFAR","group":"Organization","image":"img/PEPFAR.png","value":1,"notes":""},{"id":170,"title":"Rockefeller University","group":"Organization","image":"img/Rockefeller_University.png","value":1,"notes":""},{"id":171,"title":"National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine - Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats","group":"Organization","image":"img/National_Academies_of_Sciences,_Engineering,_and_Medicine_-_Standing_Committee_on_Emerging_Infectious_Diseases_and_21st_Century_Health_Threats.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/standing-committee-on-emerging-infectious-diseases-and-21st-century-health-threats\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/standing-committee-on-emerging-infectious-diseases-and-21st-century-health-threats</a><br/>Description<br/>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will convene a standing committee of experts to help inform OSTP and HHS/ASPR on critical science and policy issues related to emerging infectious diseases and other public health threats.

This mission has been to solve the scientific and technical hurdles blocking access to life changing protein therapeutics. Enormous progress has been made over the last 30 years in biotechnology, with the discovery and development of new and effective protein therapeutics across the spectrum of human disease. The cost of making these complex therapeutics has also decreased substantially, but unfortunately not enough, to make current and future protein therapeutics accessible to a growing global population. Completing the mission will require an intense focus on the development of innovative and integrated technologies; from the design of therapeutic molecules to the design of the plants used for manufacturing them.

Mundo de los Microbios hosted by Gary Toranzos, is ASM's weekly Spanish-language podcast. Meet the Microbiologist is a podcast hosted by Julie Wolf, Ph.D., that showcases the people behind the scientific discoveries in various cutting-edge areas of the microbial sciences.<br/>Advocacy<br/>ASM empowers members to advocate for the highest standards in scientific practice and provides members opportunities to advocate for evidence-based scientific policy.<br/>ASM restructured its advocacy program to enhance its effectiveness in Washington, D.C., and its expansion to the Branches and various local communities. In 2018, ASM engaged members of Congress and issued statements in conjunction with Congressional hearings focusing on recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like the measles. In 2017 and 2018, ASM played a leading role, working with coalition partners, to raise the federal budget caps and advance funding for science and public health agencies like the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, National Institute for Food and Agriculture at the USDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ASM members sent nearly 2,000 messages to Members of Congress in support of increased science funding. Noteworthy is the appreciation of ASM by CDC, since raising the caps made specifically possible the construction of the new biocontainment lab.<br/>In 2018, ASM advocated successfully for establishing PACCARB (President's Advisory Council for Combatting Antibiotic Resistance Bacteria) into the law (from an Obama administration Executive Order), by including language in the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act. ASM convened a meeting with more than 20 stakeholder groups to discuss a collective path forward for federally-focused advocacy in support of microbiome research.<br/>See also<br/>Microbial art<br/>MicrobeLibrary<br/>Society for General Microbiology<br/>References<br/> \"Timeline of the Society.

Nabel was born in Hartford, Connecticut and is married to Elizabeth Nabel. Their three children are all pursuing careers as physician-scientists.<br/>Education<br/>Nabel completed his undergraduate, M.D., and Ph.D. studies at Harvard University (1975, 1980, and 1982, respectively). He completed his dissertation research in the laboratory of immunologist Harvey Cantor and then worked as a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of David Baltimore at the Whitehead Institute, studying regulation of HIV gene expression by the recently discovered NF-&#954;B, a host transcription factor.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93; He completed his Internal Medicine residency at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital.<br/>Career<br/>Gary J. Nabel, M.D., Ph.D. is a virologist and immunologist working on immune therapies and vaccines for cancer and infectious diseases. His scientific career has focused on the intersection of virology, immunology, gene therapy and molecular biology. Researching the molecular genetics and structure of viral replication, his approach to structure-based vaccine design has helped to catalyze the development of vaccines for global health threats.<br/>Nabel joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1987, where he led a research lab focused on infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy. Nabel was an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute until 1999,&#91;3&#93; working on transcriptional regulation of cell and viral gene expressions, as well as viral vectors in gene therapy.&#91;4&#93; He was the Sewell Professor of Internal Medicine and Biological Chemistry.<br/>In 1999, Nabel was recruited to build a vaccine research program for the country at the National Institutes of Health in Washington, DC. He served as the founding director of Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH and Senior Investigator with tenure at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. At NIH, Nabel pioneered a renaissance in vaccine development through structure-based rational vaccine design. Nabel provided overall direction and scientific leadership of the basic, clinical, and translational research activities and guided development of novel vaccine strategies. This vaccine work spanned basic science to clinical trials, including more than 100 clinical studies in the United States, Europe, and Africa, including SARS, Chikungunya, universal influenza vaccines and Ebola vaccines eventually tested in Africa.<br/>Nabel moved to Sanofi in 2012, and as Chief Scientific Officer and Senior Vice President, he oversaw the Breakthrough Lab, which developed the first trispecific antibodies now in development for HIV.&#91;5&#93; He also provided oversight of the Sanofi global R&D research portfolio, helping to guide more than ten products a year into clinical efficacy trials and bringing numerous products to licensure.<br/>Nabel is currently President and Chief Executive Officer for ModeX Therapeutics in Natick, Massachusetts.<br/>Biomedical Research<br/>Over the course of his career, Dr. Nabel discovered the first effective vaccine candidates for Ebola, Chikungunya and encephalitis viruses through his approach to rational design using molecular virology, structure and immunology. This work catalyzed a renaissance in the vaccine field and led to novel passive and active immune interventions for universal influenza, EBV, and AIDS. He is author of more than 450 scientific publications, and he holds 86 patents.<br/>At the University of Michigan, Nabel&#8217;s basic research investigated gene transfer,&#91;6&#93; basic mechanisms of HIV gene regulation and NF-&#954;B transcriptional control.&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93;<br/>As founding director of NIH&#8217;s Vaccine Research Center, Nabel pioneered a renaissance in vaccine development through his rational approach to vaccine design. Understanding the molecular genetics and structure of viral replication, he discovered the first vaccine against Ebola, using gene-based immunization to completely protect against infection in non-human primates.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; This work provided the conceptual basis that served as a prototype for the VSV vaccine recently proven efficacious in humans. He developed the first Chikungunya virus vaccine effective in primates and advanced universal influenza vaccines of unprecedented breadth and potency. His rational approach to structure-based vaccine design led to elucidation of broadly protective human immune responses to HIV,&#91;11&#93; leading to the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies to the highly conserved CD4 binding site of HIV with his colleagues from the VRC. Recently, he created an innovative antibody platform, trispecific Abs, that show unprecedented anti-HIV breadth and potency. These antibodies have advanced into human trials.<br/>Recognizing the threat of Ebola virus decades ago, he applied molecular immunology and virology analysis to identify genes critical to Ebola replication and assembly. Importantly, he showed that gene-based prime-boost immunization stimulates potent cellular and humoral immune responses and discovered the first protective vaccine for highly lethal Ebola virus in non-human primates,&#91;12&#93; defined its immune mechanism of protection, and guided its development and testing in Africa. His work has stimulated international progress against emerging pathogens, having advanced novel SARS&#91;13&#93; and pandemic influenza.&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93; vaccines into clinical trials in record time, while creating promising candidates for encephalitis viruses and EBV.<br/>At NIH&#8217;s Vaccine Research Center, he also contributed seminal advances to vaccine science neutralizing antibodies against HIV, universal influenza,&#91;16&#93; Ebola,&#91;17&#93; Chikungunya,&#91;18&#93; and Epstein-Barr virus.&#91;19&#93; He led research on viral molecular biology, protein structure, and immunotherapy, which defined modes of immune escape and led to the discovery of the broadly neutralizing antibodies to the highly conserved CD4 binding site of HIV that are now in human efficacy trials in Africa.&#91;20&#93;<br/>At Sanofi, Nabel developed a novel antibody platform that can recognize three targets in a single protein, trispecific antibodies, now under evaluation for the treatment and prevention of AIDS and cancer.&#91;21&#93; &#91;22&#93;<br/>Nabel has also worked on EBV vaccine development for nearly a decade, since first sponsoring a meeting at the NIH&#8217;s Vaccine Research Center with the participation of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease and the National Cancer Institute.

His primary focus is on international financing for global health, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Prior to joining CSIS, he worked as an independent consultant focused on addressing urgent global health challenges. Most recently, he has been working on behalf of the Global Fund Board of Directors as chair of its Strategy, Investment, and Impact Committee.<br/>It&#8217;s an exciting time for those fighting AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria: new knowledge and interventions give us unprecedented opportunity to change dramatically the course of all three epidemics, saving both lives and money. This builds on tremendous progress already made on reducing global morbidity and mortality rates: annual AIDS-related deaths dropped 40% since 2005; TB deaths dropped 40% since 1990; and malaria deaths are down by more than 25% globally since 2000.<br/>Yet at the same time, the organization established to help finance this fight &#8211; the Global Fund &#8211; has been struggling to adapt to an increasingly austere funding environment and to transform itself from a passive funder into a more proactive investor. It has also had to deal with significant management and governance challenges, poor performance and occasionally fraud in some beneficiary countries, and a rapidly challenging relationship with key funding and technical partners.<br/>Much of this came to a head last fall, when the Global Fund&#8217;s board of directors met in Accra, Ghana. At this tumultuous meeting, the board unanimously agreed on a bold new five-year strategy (&#8220;Investing for Impact&#8221;), canceled the current funding round due to lack of funds, implemented an overhaul of its governance processes, and forced out the executive director by agreeing to hire an interim general manager to assume all management responsibilities. The process itself left deep wounds between and among board constituencies, management, implementing countries, and advocates.<br/>Over the past year, work has been underway to heal these wounds and get back to the business of saving lives. The general manager has led a transformation of the Global Fund&#8217;s Geneva-based secretariat, the board has delegated more responsibility to new committees and set in place a search for a new executive director, and advocates have resumed work to make a case for increased contributions from donors. Implementing countries are perhaps still coming to grips with all of the changes, wondering whether they can still rely on the Global Fund to finance major expansion of their efforts to fight the three diseases.<br/>This November, nearly a year after Accra, the board will take important steps in getting the Global Fund back up to full speed. A new funding model that fits its updated strategy is set for approval, a new executive director will be chosen to lead the team, and the next three-year replenishment process will start among donors.  Next spring, the Board will choose a new chair and vice chair, who will have to support the new executive director and continue the work to improve governance.  Three priorities for the Global Fund are clear:<br/>Implement the Strategy: Putting the new funding model in place is an important part, but other critical aspects remain, especially work to address human rights barriers that continue to prevent many people from accessing lifesaving prevention and treatment services.<br/>Increase Sustainability: Many countries receiving Global Fund support struggle to demonstrate the scale of political and financial commitment needed to ensure long-term program sustainability.  The Global Fund, hand in hand with the US and other big-muscled donors, is going to have to engage political leaders (Ministers of Finance and Heads of State) to get them to take increasing responsibility for addressing the three diseases and other health needs.  Focus should be on the 20 or so countries that account for most of the burden for AIDS, TB, and malaria.<br/>Make the Case: Every day, funds provided by the Global Fund save lives across the world, yet few people know of its impact.  For political leaders to sustain and increase support, the Global Fund will need to do more to demonstrate that it is an effective, efficient, and focused institution.  It will also have to harness the incredible capacity of advocacy groups like the ONE Campaign to help it tell its great story to the public, and to motivate them to communicate support to their political leaders.<br/>The Global Fund is indeed at a pivotal moment. Hopefully, wounds have largely healed, and a newly revitalized Global Fund will emerge better able to support countries in seizing the very real opportunity to bring an end to three of the most deadly epidemics in history. While it may take another generation, every day counts when the metric for success is life or death for millions."},{"id":199,"title":"Hannah Kettler","group":"Person","image":"img/placeholder.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/expert/hannah-kettler\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.cgdev.org/expert/hannah-kettler</a><br/>Hannah Kettler<br/>Non-Resident Fellow<br/>Topics:<br/>Global Health, Vaccines, Global Health Innovation and Access: Sustainable Business Models<br/>Bio<br/>Dr. Hannah Kettler is a global expert in corporate social innovation, currently serving as the Director for Financing and Partnerships at PATH&#8217;s Center for Vaccines Innovation and Access.

(See also: Dark Winter Script &#8226; Article: Shining Light on Dark Winter)<br/>With tensions rising in the Taiwan Straits, and a major crisis developing in Southwest Asia, a smallpox outbreak was confirmed by the CDC in Oklahoma City. During the thirteen days of the game, the disease spread to 25 states and 15 other countries. Fourteen participants and 60 observers witnessed terrorism/warfare in slow motion. Discussions, debates (some rather heated), and decisions focused on the public health response, lack of an adequate supply of smallpox vaccine, roles and missions of federal and state governments, civil liberties associated with quarantine and isolation, the role of DoD, and potential military responses to the anonymous attack. Additionally, a predictable 24/7 news cycle quickly developed that focused the nation and the world on the attack and response. Five representatives from the national press corps (including print and broadcast) participated in the game and conducted a lengthy press conference with the President.

At the start of the meeting, the Director of Health and Human Services informed the President of a confirmed case of smallpox in Oklahoma City. Additional smallpox cases were soon identified in Georgia and Pennsylvania. More cases were reported in Oklahoma. The source of the infection was unknown, and exposure was presumed to have taken place at least nine days earlier due to the lengthy incubation period of smallpox. Consequently, exposed individuals had likely traveled far from the loci of what was now presumed to be a biological attack. The scenario spanned 13 days.<br/>Findings<br/>An attack on the United States with biological weapons could threaten vital national security interests. Massive civilian casualties, breakdown in essential institutions, violation of democratic processes, civil disorder, loss of confidence in government and reduced U.S. strategic flexibility abroad are among the ways a biological attack might compromise U.S. security.<br/>Current organizational structures and capabilities are not well suited for the management of a BW attack. Major \"fault lines\" exist between different levels of government (federal, state, and local), between government and the private sector, among different institutions and agencies, and within the public and private sector. These \"disconnects\" could impede situational awareness and compromise the ability to limit loss of life, suffering, and economic damage.<br/>There is no surge capability in the U.S. healthcare and public health systems, or in the pharmaceutical and vaccine industries. This institutionally limited surge capacity could result in hospitals being overwhelmed and becoming inoperable, and it could impede public health agencies' analysis of the scope, source and progress of the epidemic, their ability to educate and reassure the public, and their capacity to limit causalities and the spread of disease.<br/>Dealing with the media will be a major immediate challenge for all levels of government. Information management and communication (e.g., dealing with the press effectively, communication with citizens, maintaining the information flows necessary for command and control at all institutional levels) will be a critical element in crisis/consequence management.<br/>Should a contagious bioweapon pathogen be used, containing the spread of disease will present significant ethical, political, cultural, operational, and legal challenges.<br/>Smallpox, because of its high case-fatality rates and transmissibility, represents one of the most serious biological warfare threats to the civilian population. In 1980, the World Health Assembly announced that smallpox had been eradicated and recommended that all countries cease vaccination. Although labs in two countries still officially store smallpox samples (U.S. and Russia), its re-appearance would almost certainly indicate an intentional outbreak.<br/>Aerosol release of smallpox virus disseminated among a relatively small population could result in a significant epidemic. Evidence suggests the infectious dose is very small. Several factors are cause for concern: the disease has historically been feared as one of the most serious of all pestilential diseases; it is physically disfiguring; it bears a 30 percent case-fatality rate; there is no treatment; it is communicable from person to person. Vaccination ceased in this country in 1972, and vaccination immunity acquired before that time has undoubtedly waned. Prior to eradication, data on smallpox outbreaks in Europe indicated that victims had the potential to infect 10 to 20 others. However, there has never been a smallpox outbreak in such a densely populated, highly mobile, unvaccinated population such as exists today.<br/>In 1947, in response to a single case of smallpox in New York City, 6,350,000 people were immunized (500,000 in one day), including President Harry Truman. In 1972, after disappearing from Yugoslavia for four decades, a single case of smallpox emerged. There are two ways to control a smallpox epidemic - vaccine and isolation. Yugoslavia's Communist leader, Josip Tito, used both. He instituted a nation-wide quarantine, and immunized the entire country of 20 million people using vaccine supplied by the World Health Organization.<br/>Estimates of the current U.S. supply of smallpox vaccine range from 7 to 12 million doses. This stock cannot be immediately replenished, since all vaccine production facilities were dismantled after 1980, and renewed vaccine production is estimated to require at least 24-36 months. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently contracted with Acambis Inc. of Cambridge MA to produce 40 million doses of new vaccine.<br/>"},{"id":212,"title":"Nikolaj Gilbert","group":"Person","image":"img/placeholder.png","value":1,"notes":"Nikolaj Gilbert is president and chief executive officer of PATH.

Atlantic Storm was a ministerial table-top exercise convened on January 14, 2005 by the Center for Biosecurity of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the Center for Transatlantic Relations of the Johns Hopkins University, and the Transatlantic Biosecurity Network. The exercise used a fictitious scenario designed to mimic a summit of transatlantic leaders forced to respond to a bioterrorist attack. These transatlantic leaders were played by current and former officials from each country or organization represented at the table. There was an audience of observers from governments on both sides of the Atlantic as well as from the private sector, but the venue was designed to focus all attention on the summit principals and their discussions around the table .<br/>Take a ringside seat with Atlantic Storm Interactive: The interactive presentation brings the event to life as you watch the news, learn the facts, read the briefings, and listen to excerpts of the players' discussions--from the ringside perspective of an observer, or from the hot seat perspective of a world leader facing a global outbreak of a deadly infectious disease. Atlantic Storm Interactive walks you through the day, unveiling events, materials, and developments in the same sequence in which they were unveiled to the players. You can listen to audio that highlights the most important moments in the players' deliberations, watch videos that brought the scenario to life for the players, and use an interactive timeline to move back and forth through the day.

The multi-year project seeks to identify, develop, publicize, and promote concrete and normative actions to reduce global catastrophic biological risks associated with advances in technology.<br/>Participants included global leaders in the related fields of genomics, virology, microbiology, security, bioethics, research funding, and science publishing.<br/>Recognizing that advances in biotechnology are rapidly outpacing the ability of governments to provide effective oversight, Initiative participants discussed the vision and actions that would guide the effort and agreed to take forward specific proposals for researchers, institutions, companies, and investors to reduce risks.  <br/>In advance of this Initiative kickoff meeting, multiple authors from different sectors and countries drafted detailed concept papers outlining steps that could be taken to reduce risks associated with advances in technology. Each of these papers was informed by discussions during a meeting organized by NTI, Wellcome Trust, and the World Economic Forum under Chatham House Rule in June 2018.  <br/>Universal Platform to Prevent Illicit Gene Synthesis<br/>Instituting Biosecurity Investment<br/>Standards for Funders and Grantees to Identify and Mitigate Biological Risks<br/>Insurance Incentives for Reducing Biological Risks<br/>Establishing a Seal of Approval to Incentivize Adherence to Biosecurity Norms<br/>In addition to the five concept papers, a sixth paper included topics for additional consideration by the Initiative. Aspects of these topics may be integrated with planned working groups or revisited following additional research and discussion. <br/>Initiative members also discussed and agreed on the importance of four additional areas for future work:<br/>Incentivizing technical innovation to build safer and more security technologies, including incentivizing a cadre of scientists and engineers who are focused on countering negative outcomes associated with new biotechnologies.<br/>Global oversight &#8211; such as existing models for oversight of smallpox research or prequalification of certain types of laboratories &#8211; of research that enhances the transmissibility or virulence of potentially pandemic pathogens.<br/>Establishing publishing standards for potentially risky research, including consistent biosecurity review practices, consideration of a &#8220;no undercut policy,&#8221; standards for removing pre-prints that may pose a concern, and establishing an independent review body.<br/>Developing one or more multilateral governance models for mitigating biological risks associated with advances in technology.  A global oversight committee that functions as a good-faith broker mediating between stakeholders might be able to facilitate quick and adaptive responses to biosecurity challenges as they arise.<br/>Photos from the kickoff event can be viewed below: <br/>ejm birr<br/>deb BIRR<br/>BIRR<br/>amadou<br/>Share<br/><a href=\"http://nti.org/7373EP\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">http://nti.org/7373EP</a><br/>"},{"id":245,"title":"NTI - 2019-12-xx -  Washington, DC Tabletop Exercise Participants","group":"MeetingBusiness","image":"img/event.png","value":1,"notes":""},{"id":246,"title":"Jaime Yassif","group":"Person","image":"img/placeholder.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://www.nti.org/about/leadership-and-staff/jaime-yassif-phd/\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.nti.org/about/leadership-and-staff/jaime-yassif-phd/</a><br/>Jaime Yassif, Ph.D.<br/>Senior Fellow, Global Biological Policy and Programs<br/>Jaime Yassif is a senior fellow for global biological policy and programs at NTI.

These technologies support myriad advancements in synthetic biology, which offers the potential for increased efficiency and sustainability, and drives advancements in the energy, food, agriculture, health and manufacturing industries. Further advances in technology hold great promise for sustainable development and a safer and more secure society.<br/>At the same time, new approaches to DNA editing and synthesis have made it easier to manipulate biological agents and systems, increasing the risk of a catastrophic accidental or deliberate biological event. These technologies make it possible to create pathogen or toxin DNA that could be accidentally or deliberately misused. For example, in 2018 researchers published work detailing the synthesis of horsepox virus, an extinct virus related to smallpox, using synthetic DNA fragments purchased from a commercial provider. This demonstrated the potential for creating other viruses via commercially available technologies.<br/>Although many DNA providers practice screening procedures to help prevent the misuse of synthetic DNA, these practices are becoming increasingly expensive relative to other business costs, increasing the economic pressure to limit such voluntary procedures. As access expands and the cost of DNA synthesis declines, more DNA will be in commerce, and additional DNA providers may enter the market, further expanding the range of people using synthetic DNA. In the next two to three years, a new generation of benchtop DNA synthesis machines, enabled by enzymatic DNA synthesis methods, could become available without guidance or norms to prevent misuse.<br/>This report, endorsed by an international expert Working Group, recommends a global system to expand synthetic DNA screening practices by developing an international, cost-effective, and sustainable mechanism to prevent illicit DNA synthesis and misuse. The new framework offers an improvement on existing voluntary guidelines because it standardizes screening processes, is accessible to new players in the market, and provides valuable feedback data to evaluate the screening &#8211; all at lower costs."},{"id":248,"title":"Beth Cameron","group":"Person","image":"img/Beth_Cameron.png","value":1,"notes":"<br/>Beth Cameron, PhD<br/>Beth Cameron was formerly NTI&#8217;s vice president for global biological policy and programs.<br/>Cameron previously served as the senior director for global health security and biodefense on the White House National Security Council (NSC) staff, where she was instrumental in developing and launching the Global Health Security Agenda and addressed homeland and national security threats surrounding biosecurity and biosafety, biodefense, emerging infectious disease threats, biological select agents and toxins, dual&#8208;use research, and bioterrorism.<br/><a href=\"https://www.nti.org/about/leadership-and-staff/beth-cameron/\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.nti.org/about/leadership-and-staff/beth-cameron/</a><br/>From 2010&#8208;2013, Cameron served as office director for Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) and senior advisor for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs.

It was a reformation of the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists.&#91;3&#93; The society chose William Charles Redfield as their first president&#91;4&#93; because he had proposed the most comprehensive plans for the organization. According to the first constitution which was agreed to at the September 20 meeting, the goal of the society was to promote scientific dialogue in order to allow for greater scientific collaboration.&#91;5&#93; By doing so the association aimed to use resources to conduct science with increased efficiency and allow for scientific progress at a greater rate.&#91;6&#93; The association also sought to increase the resources available to the scientific community through active advocacy of science. There were only 78 members when the AAAS was formed.&#91;7&#93; As a member of the new scientific body, Matthew Fontaine Maury, USN was one of those who attended the first 1848 meeting.&#91;8&#93;<br/>At a meeting held on Friday afternoon, September 22, 1848, Redfield presided, and Matthew Fontaine Maury gave a full scientific report on his Wind and Current Charts. Maury stated that hundreds of ship navigators were now sending abstract logs of their voyages to the United States Naval Observatory. He added, \"Never before was such a corps of observers known.\"&#91;7&#93; But, he pointed out to his fellow scientists, his critical need was for more \"simultaneous observations.\" \"The work,\" Maury stated, \"is not exclusively for the benefit of any nation or age.\" The minutes of the AAAS meeting reveal that because of the universality of this \"view on the subject, it was suggested whether the states of Christendom might not be induced to cooperate with their Navies in the undertaking; at least so far as to cause abstracts of their log-books and sea journals to be furnished to Matthew F. Maury, USN, at the Naval Observatory at Washington.\"<br/>William Barton Rogers, professor at the University of Virginia and later founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offered a resolution: \"Resolved that a Committee of five be appointed to address a memorial to the Secretary of the Navy, requesting his further aid in procuring for Matthew Maury the use of the observations of European and other foreign navigators, for the extension and perfecting of his charts of winds and currents.\" The resolution was adopted and, in addition to Rogers, the following members of the association were appointed to the committee: Professor Joseph Henry of Washington; Professor Benjamin Peirce of Cambridge, Massachusetts; Professor James H. Coffin of Easton, Pennsylvania, and Professor Stephen Alexander of Princeton, New Jersey.&#91;9&#93; This was scientific cooperation, and Maury went back to Washington with great hopes for the future.<br/>In 1850, the first female members were accepted, they were: astronomer Maria Mitchell, entomologist Margaretta Morris, and science educator Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps.<br/>Growth and Civil War dormancy<br/>This section needs additional citations for verification.

The AAAS became dormant during the American Civil War; their August 1861 meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, was postponed indefinitely after the outbreak of the first major engagement of the war at Bull Run. The AAAS did not become a permanent casualty of the war.<br/>In 1866, Frederick Barnard presided over the first meeting of the resurrected AAAS at a meeting in New York City. Following the revival of the AAAS, the group had considerable growth. The AAAS permitted all people, regardless of scientific credentials, to join. The AAAS did, however, institute a policy of granting the title of \"Fellow of the AAAS\" to well-respected scientists within the organization. The years of peace brought the development and expansion of other scientific-oriented groups. The AAAS's focus on the unification of many fields of science under a single organization was in contrast to the many new science organizations founded to promote a single discipline. For example, the American Chemical Society, founded in 1876, promotes chemistry.<br/>In 1863, the US Congress established the National Academy of Sciences, another multidisciplinary sciences organization. It elects members based on recommendations from colleagues and the value of published works.<br/>Twentieth century<br/>Wiki letter w.svg<br/>This article is missing information about literally anything that happened between 1864 and the year 2000.

The Force.com platform typically receives three complete releases a year.&#91;32&#93; As the platform is provided as a service to its developers, every single development instance also receives all these updates.<br/>In 2015, a new framework for building user interfaces &#8211; Lightning Components &#8211; was introduced in beta.&#91;33&#93; Lightning components are built using the open-source Aura Framework&#91;34&#93; but with support for Apex as the server-side language instead of Aura's Javascript dependency. This has been described as an alternative to, not necessarily a replacement for, Visualforce pages.&#91;35&#93;<br/>As of 2013, the Force.com platform has 1.4 million registered developers.&#91;36&#93;<br/>Lightning Base Components is the component library built on top of Lightning Web Components.&#91;37&#93;<br/>Experience Cloud<br/>Experience Cloud (formerly Community Cloud)&#91;38&#93; provides Salesforce customers the ability to create online web properties for external collaboration, customer service, channel sales, and other custom portals in their instance of Salesforce.

Desk.com is owned by Salesforce.com and was previously known as Assistly. Desk.com is headquartered in San Francisco, California.<br/>After being acquired by Salesforce.com for $50 million in 2011&#91;63&#93; Assistly was re-branded as Desk.com in 2012&#91;64&#93; as a customer support software.&#91;65&#93;<br/>Desk.com is a SaaS customer service application.

The Do.com domain was sold to a startup in 2014.&#91;74&#93;<br/>Configuration<br/>Salesforce users can configure their CRM application. In the system, there are tabs such as \"Contacts,\" \"Reports,\" and \"Accounts.\" Each tab contains associated information. Configuration can be done on each tab by adding user-defined custom fields.&#91;75&#93;<br/>Configuration can also be done at the \"platform\" level by adding configured applications to a Salesforce instance, that is adding sets of customized / novel tabs for specific vertical- or function-level (Finance, Human Resources, etc.) features.<br/>Web services<br/>In addition to the web interface, Salesforce offers a SOAP/REST Web service application programming interface (API) that enables integration with other systems.&#91;76&#93;&#91;77&#93;<br/>Technologies<br/>Salesforce is powered by the Model&#8211;view&#8211;controller architecture.<br/>Apex<br/>Apex is a proprietary programming language provided by the Force.com platform to developers similar to Java and C#. It is a strongly typed, object-oriented, case-insensitive programming language, following a dot-notation and curly-brackets syntax. Apex can be used to execute programmed functions during most processes on the Force.com platform including custom buttons and links, event handlers on record insertion, update, or deletion, via scheduling, or via the custom controllers of Visualforce or Lightning Experience pages.<br/>Due to the multitenant nature of the platform, the language has strictly imposed governor limitations&#91;78&#93; to guard against any code monopolizing shared resources. Salesforce provides a series of asynchronous processing methods for Apex to allow developers to produce longer-running and more complex Apex code.&#91;79&#93;<br/>Lightning<br/>In 2014, Salesforce made public the front end of its platform, called Lightning.&#91;80&#93; This component-based framework is what the Salesforce mobile app is built on. Salesforce built on this framework in 2015 by releasing the Lightning Design System,&#91;81&#93; an HTML style framework with default CSS styling built in. This framework allows customers to build their own components to either use in their internal instances or sell on the AppExchange.<br/>The Salesforce Lightning App Builder is a tool for rapid application development of responsive web interfaces. This interface allows for different screens to be put together based on Lightning components. This can be used as layouts for records or specific applications.<br/>Lightning Experience, released in 2016, is the new redesigned interface in Salesforce for processes enhancement. Since then all the apps available on AppExchange need to be Lightning and those built on Classic have to migrate to Lightning as Classic is not to be updated any more by Salesforce. The platform offers an option for developers to employ migration techniques to enable the new user friendly interface and switch to Lightning.&#91;82&#93;<br/>Operations<br/>A discussion panel at Salesforce's Customer Company Tour event that focused on customer relationship management<br/>Salesforce is headquartered in San Francisco, with regional headquarters in Morges, Switzerland (covering Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, Singapore), India (covering Asia Pacific minus Japan), and Tokyo (covering Japan).

The leaders at Salesforce believed that its culture fostered dialogue, collaboration, recognition, and a sense of family, and helped its employees drive the company&#8217;s purpose, vision, and impact.&#91;99&#93; Though, in the aftermath of a 2021 world-wide outage of all their services, in an uncharacteristic move, Salesforce Chief Availability Officer Darryn Dieken placed the blame on an individual engineer stating, \"We have taken action with that particular employee.\"&#91;102&#93; The same year, another executive Cynthia Perry resigned over discrimination in the workplace.&#91;103&#93;<br/>Finances<br/>For the fiscal year 2019, Salesforce reported revenue of US$13.28 billion, an increase of 26% year-over-year and 26% in constant currency.

Data.com does, however, make it easy to remove business information on request as noted in December 2009 by TechCrunch.&#91;178&#93; However, recipients of these messages regard it as spam and at least one complaint about receiving more spam after attempting to remove one's address has been noted.&#91;179&#93;<br/>Attempt to trademark Social enterprise<br/>In July 2012, Salesforce applied to trademark the term \"social enterprise\" in the United States, the European Union and Jamaica where the term was in widespread use to describe businesses with a primarily social purpose. This was successfully challenged by a campaign called #notinourname which was launched by Social Enterprise UK, resulting in Salesforce.com withdrawing their trademark application and agreeing not to use the term in their future marketing.&#91;180&#93;&#91;181&#93;<br/>&#8216;Meatpistol&#8217; presenters let go at Def Con<br/>In 2017 at DEF CON, Salesforce's Director of Offensive Security and a security engineer were fired on the conference room floor in front of several other attendees by an executive at the company after giving a talk. Word rapidly spread that two speakers had been released at the event.&#91;182&#93; The presentation was initially signed off on by the company; however, Salesforce's management team had an unexplained and sudden change of heart an hour before the event.&#91;183&#93; Salesforce's Director of Offensive Security had turned off his phone prior to the presentation and was unable to receive any communication from Salesforce prior to the presentation.&#91;182&#93; Reaction after the firings were swift, with the Electronic Frontier Foundation providing representation to the fired employees&#91;182&#93; and members of the security community opining \"Salesforce undermined their credibility in the security community to a significant degree\" and that \"how they are perceived by the security community isn't top of their list of things they care about.\"&#91;184&#93; The presented MEATPISTOL tool was anticipated to be released as open-source at the time of the presentation, but Salesforce continues to hold back on releasing any of the code to developers or the public.&#91;185&#93; The terminated employees have continued to call on the company to open-source the software.&#91;186&#93;<br/>RAICES donation refusal<br/>The not-for-profit organization Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES) rejected a US$250,000 philanthropic donation from Salesforce because the company has contracts with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The executive director of Raices, Jonathan Ryan, tweeted that \"When it comes to supporting oppressive, inhumane, and illegal policies, we want to be clear: the only right action is to stop\" in reference to the rejected donation.&#91;187&#93; Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff responded in an official statement that the company's employees \"don't work with CBP regarding separation of families. CBP is a customer & follows our TOS. We don't have an agreement with ICE. I'm Proud of the Men & Women who protect & serve our country every day & I'm Proud of our Ohana.\"&#91;188&#93;<br/>It was reported that, in a change to its acceptable-use policy,&#91;189&#93; Salesforce is barring customers from using its system to sell semiautomatic guns and other firearms.&#91;190&#93;&#91;191&#93;<br/>Tax avoidance<br/>In December 2019, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that Salesforce was one of 91 companies who \"paid an effective federal tax rate of 0% or less\" in 2018, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.&#91;192&#93; Their findings were published in a report based on the 379 Fortune 500 companies that declared a profit in 2018.&#91;193&#93;<br/>Lawsuit<br/>In March 2019 Salesforce faced a lawsuit by 50 anonymous women claiming to be victims and survivors of sex trafficking, abuse and rape, which alleges the company profited from and knowingly facilitated sex trafficking on the Web site Backpage.com (defunct since April 2018).&#91;194&#93; The lawsuit also pointed out that Salesforce was publicly promoting an anti-human trafficking campaign at the time of its work with Backpage.&#91;195&#93;&#91;196&#93;<br/>Salesforce Ventures<br/>In 2009, in response to the financial crisis of 2007&#8211;2008 and the resulting decline in venture funding, Salesforce began investing in digital companies that used or integrated Salesforce platform.&#91;197&#93; This eventually became Salesforce Ventures, headed by John Somorjai&#91;197&#93;&#91;198&#93; Since then various funds have been created to focus on specific areas &#8212; in September 2014 SFV set up Salesforce1 Fund, aimed at start-ups creating applications primarily for mobile phones. In December 2018, Salesforce Ventures announced the launch of the Japan Trailblazer Fund, focused on Japanese startups.&#91;199&#93;<br/>As of August 2018, Salesforce Ventures reported investments totaling $1.2 billion in 275 companies covering a wide range of business models, including e-commerce (CloudCraze),&#91;200&#93; artificial intelligence (Figure Eight), online fraud prevention (Forter),&#91;201&#93; Accounting and Professional Services Automation software (FinancialForce)&#91;202&#93; and many other areas.&#91;203&#93; Its five largest investments Domo (data-visualization software), SurveyMonkey (online survey software), Twilio (cloud-communication), Dropbox (cloud storage), and DocuSign (secure e-signature company) account for nearly half of its portfolio.&#91;204&#93;<br/>See also<br/>Salesforce Tower<br/>Salesforce Tower Indianapolis<br/>Salesforce Marketing Cloud<br/>SalesforceIQ"},{"id":275,"title":"Care International","group":"Organization","image":"img/placeholder.png","value":1,"notes":"<br/><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_International\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_International</a><br/>Care International<br/>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>Jump to navigationJump to search<br/>\"CARE\" redirects here.

Founded in 1945, CARE is nonsectarian, impartial, and non-governmental. It is one of the largest and oldest humanitarian aid organizations focused on fighting global poverty. In 2019, CARE reported working in 104 countries, supporting 1,349 poverty-fighting projects and humanitarian aid projects, and reaching over 92.3 million people directly and 433.3 million people indirectly.&#91;2&#93;<br/>CARE's programmes in the developing world address a broad range of topics including emergency response, food security, water and sanitation, economic development, climate change, agriculture, education, and health. CARE also advocates at the local, national, and international levels for policy change and the rights of poor people. Within each of these areas, CARE focuses on empowering and meeting the needs of women and girls and promoting gender equality.&#91;2&#93;<br/>CARE International is a confederation of fourteen CARE National Members, each of which is registered as an autonomous non-profit non-governmental organization in the country and four affiliate members.<br/>Contents<br/>1&#9;History<br/>1.1&#9;1945&#8211;1949: Origins and the CARE Package<br/>1.2&#9;1949&#8211;1956: Transition out of Europe<br/>1.3&#9;1957&#8211;1975: Transition into broader development work<br/>1.4&#9;1975&#8211;1990: From CARE to CARE International<br/>1.5&#9;1990&#8211;present: Recent history<br/>1.5.1&#9;Microfinance<br/>1.5.2&#9;Acronym redefinition and 50th anniversary<br/>2&#9;CARE&#8217;s structure<br/>3&#9;Programming scope<br/>3.1&#9;Emergency response<br/>4&#9;Networks and partnerships<br/>5&#9;References<br/>6&#9;External links<br/>History<br/>A CARE Package shipped in 1948.<br/>1945&#8211;1949: Origins and the CARE Package<br/>CARE, then the Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe, was formally founded on November 27, 1945,&#91;3&#93; and was originally intended to be a temporary organization.&#91;4&#93; World War II had ended in August of the same year. After pressure from the public and Congress, President Harry S. Truman agreed to let private organizations provide relief for those starving due to the war.&#91;5&#93; CARE was initially a consortium of twenty-two U.S. charities (a mixture of civic, religious, cooperative, farm, and labour organizations) with the purpose of delivering food aid to Europe in the aftermath of World War II.&#91;6&#93; The organization delivered its first food packages in 1946.<br/>CARE's food aid took the form of CARE Packages, which were at first delivered to specific individuals: the US people paid $10 to send a CARE Package of food to a loved one in Europe, often a family member. President Truman bought the first CARE package.&#91;7&#93;:p.1 CARE guaranteed delivery within four months to anyone in Europe, even if they had left their last known address, and returned a signed delivery receipt to the sender.&#91;8&#93; Because European postal services were unreliable at the time these signed receipts were sometimes the first confirmation that the recipient had survived the war.&#91;6&#93;<br/>The first CARE Packages were in fact surplus &#8220;Ten-in-One&#8221; US army rations packs (designed to contain a day's meals for ten people).&#91;4&#93; In early 1946 CARE purchased 2.8 million of these warehoused rations packs, originally intended for the invasion of Japan, and began advertising in America. On May 11, 1946, six months after the agency's incorporation, the first CARE Packages were delivered in Le Havre, France.&#91;6&#93; These packages contained staples such as canned meats, powdered milk, dried fruits, and fats along with a few comfort items such as chocolate, coffee, and cigarettes. (Several on the CARE Board of Directors wished to remove the cigarettes, but it was deemed impractical to open and reseal 2.8 million boxes.)&#91;6&#93; 1946 also marked CARE's first expansion out of the US with the establishment of an office in Canada.&#91;9&#93;<br/>By early 1947 the supply of \"Ten-in-One\" ration packs had been exhausted and CARE began assembling its own packages.&#91;4&#93; These new packages were designed with the help of a nutritionist. They did not include cigarettes and were tailored somewhat by destination: Kosher packages were developed, and for example packages for the United Kingdom included tea rather than coffee, and packages for Italy included pasta. By 1949 CARE offered and shipped more than twelve different packages.&#91;4&#93;<br/>Although the organization had originally intended to deliver packages only to specified individuals, within a year CARE began delivering packages addressed for example \"to a teacher\" or simply \"to a hungry person in Europe.\"&#91;6&#93;:p.18 These unspecified donations continued and in early 1948 CARE's Board voted narrowly to officially move towards unspecified donations and to expand into more general relief. Some founding member agencies disagreed with this shift, arguing that more general relief would be a duplication of the work of other agencies, but donors reacted favourably, contributions increased, and this decision would mark the beginning of CARE&#8217;s shift towards a broader mandate.&#91;4&#93;<br/>Between the first deliveries of 1946 and the last European deliveries of 1956, millions of CARE Packages were distributed throughout Europe, over 50% of them to Germany&#91;9&#93; including many delivered as part of the Berlin airlift in response to the 1948 Soviet blockade of Berlin.&#91;6&#93;<br/>The US Agricultural Act of 1949 made surplus US agricultural products available to be shipped abroad as aid either directly by the US government or by NGOs including CARE.&#91;6&#93; In 1954 Public Law 480, also known as the Food for Peace Act, further expanded the availability of surplus US food as aid.&#91;4&#93; This act allowed CARE to expand its feeding programs and disaster relief operations considerably, and between 1949 and 2009 CARE used hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of surplus commodities in disaster relief and programs such as school lunch provision.&#91;6&#93;<br/>1949&#8211;1956: Transition out of Europe<br/>Although the organization's mission had originally been focused on Europe, in July 1948 CARE opened its first non-European mission, in Japan.&#91;4&#93; Deliveries to China and Korea followed, which CARE described as aid to areas \"implicated by WWII\".&#91;10&#93;:p.119 In 1949 CARE entered the developing world for the first time, launching programs in the Philippines. Projects in India, Pakistan, and Mexico began soon after.&#91;6&#93; 1949 also marked CARE's first expansion into non-food aid with the development of \"self-help\" packages containing tools for farming, carpentry, and other trades.&#91;4&#93; In 1953, because of its expansion to projects outside Europe, CARE changed the meaning of its acronym to \"Cooperative for American Remittances to Everywhere\".&#91;4&#93;<br/>As Europe recovered economically, CARE faced the need to re-evaluate its mission: in 1955 several Board members argued that with the European recovery CARE's mandate was finished and the organization should dissolve. Other Board members however felt that CARE's mission should continue albeit with a new focus on the developing world.&#91;10&#93; In July 1955 the Board of Directors voted to continue and expand CARE projects outside of Europe. Paul French, CARE's executive director at the time, resigned over the debate. New executive director Richard W. Reuter took over in 1955 and helped lead the organization in a new direction.&#91;11&#93; Twenty-two of CARE's forty-two missions were closed, mostly in European countries, and efforts were concentrated on food distribution and emergency response in the developing world.&#91;4&#93; In 1956 CARE distributed food to refugees of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and this would be among the last of CARE's operations in Europe for many years.&#91;6&#93;<br/>1957&#8211;1975: Transition into broader development work<br/>CARE commemorative U.S. stamp<br/>With a broadened geographic focus came a broadened approach as CARE began to expand beyond its original food distribution program. In order to reflect these new broader aims, in 1959 CARE changed the meaning of its acronym a second time, becoming the \"Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere\".&#91;4&#93; Reflecting this broadened scope, CARE became involved in 1961 with President John F. Kennedy's establishment of the Peace Corps. CARE was charged with selecting and training the first group of volunteers, who would later be deployed to development projects in Colombia. The Peace Corps assumed greater control over the training of Peace Corps Volunteers in subsequent missions, but CARE continued to provide country directors to the Peace Corps until CARE-Peace Corps joint projects ended in 1967.&#91;4&#93;<br/>In 1962 CARE merged with and absorbed the medical aid organization MEDICO, which it had been working closely with for several years previously. The merger considerably increased CARE's capacity to deliver health programming including trained medical personnel and medical supplies.&#91;4&#93;<br/>During this transition the original CARE Package was phased out.&#91;4&#93; The last food package was delivered in 1967 and the last tools package in 1968.&#91;12&#93; Over 100 million CARE Packages had been delivered worldwide since the first shipment to France.&#91;13&#93; Although 1968 marked the official \"retirement\" of the CARE Package the format would occasionally be used again, for example in CARE's relief to the republics of the former Soviet Union and to survivors of the Bosnian War.&#91;14&#93; The concept was also revived in 2011 as an online campaign encouraging donors to fill a \"virtual CARE Package\" with food aid and services such as education and healthcare.&#91;15&#93;<br/>1967 also marked CARE's first partnership agreement with a government: for the construction of schools in Honduras. Partnership agreements with governments led programmes to become country-wide rather than targeted only to a few communities. CARE's programmes during this era focused largely on the construction of schools and nutrition centres, and the continued distribution of food. Nutrition centres in particular would become one of CARE's major areas of concentration, linking with school feeding programs and nutrition education aimed at new mothers.&#91;4&#93;<br/>In 1975 CARE implemented a multi-year planning system, again allowing programmes to become both broader and deeper in scope. Projects became increasingly multi-faceted, providing for example not only health education but also access to clean water and an agricultural program to improve nutrition. The multi-year planning system also increased the scope for country-wide projects and partnerships with local governments. A 1977 project for example provided for the construction of over 200 pre-schools and kindergartens throughout Chile over several years, jointly funded by CARE and the Chilean Ministry of Education.&#91;4&#93;<br/>1975&#8211;1990: From CARE to CARE International<br/>Although CARE had opened an office in Canada in 1946, it was not until the mid-1970s that the organization truly started to become an international body.&#91;9&#93; CARE Canada (initially Care of Canada) became an autonomous body in 1973. In 1976 CARE Europe was established in Bonn following the successful fund-raising campaign \"Dank an CARE\" (Thanks to CARE). In 1981 CARE Germany was created and CARE Europe moved its headquarters to Paris.&#91;4&#93; CARE Norway had been created in 1980,&#91;16&#93; and CAREs in Italy and the UK were established. The popularity of CARE offices in Europe was attributed to the fact that many Europeans remembered receiving CARE assistance themselves between 1945 and 1955.&#91;4&#93;<br/>In 1979 planning began for the establishment of an umbrella organization to coordinate and prevent duplication among the various national CARE organizations. This new body was named CARE International and met for the first time on January 29, 1982, with CARE Canada, CARE Germany, CARE Norway, and CARE USA (formerly simply CARE) in attendance.&#91;4&#93;<br/>CARE International would expand significantly during the 1980s, with the addition of CARE France in 1983;&#91;17&#93; CARE International UK in 1985;&#91;18&#93; CARE Austria in 1986;&#91;19&#93; and CARE Australia, CARE Denmark, and CARE Japan in 1987.&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;<br/>1990&#8211;present: Recent history<br/>Along with broader development work CARE's projects in the 1980s and early 1990s focused particularly on agroforestry initiatives such as reforestation and soil conservation in eastern Africa and South America. CARE also responded to a number of major emergencies during this period, notably the 1983&#8211;1985 famine in Ethiopia and the 1991&#8211;1992 famine in Somalia.&#91;4&#93;<br/>The 1990s also saw an evolution in CARE's approach to poverty. Originally CARE had viewed poverty primarily as a lack of basic goods and services such as food, clean water, and health care. As CARE's scope expanded both geographically and topically this approach was expanded to include the view that poverty was in many cases caused by social exclusion, marginalization, and discrimination. In the early 1990s CARE adopted a household livelihood security framework which included a multidimensional view of poverty as encompassing not only physical resources but also social position and human capacities. As a result of this, by 2000, CARE had adopted a rights-based approach to development.&#91;13&#93;<br/>One of their buildings was attacked, and people were killed and wounded, during the September 2016 Kabul attacks.<br/>Microfinance<br/>In the early 1990s CARE also developed what would become an important model for cooperative microfinance.<br/>This model is called the Village Savings and Loans Associations and it began in 1991 as a pilot project run by CARE's Country Office in Niger.&#91;23&#93; The pilot project was called Mata Masu Dubara and CARE Niger developed the model by adapting the model of Accumulating Savings and Credit Associations. The model involve groups of about 15-30 people who regularly save and borrow using a group fund. Member savings create capital that can be used for short-term loans and capital and interest is shared among the group at the end of a given period (usually about a year), at which point the groups normally re-form to begin a new cycle. Because the bookkeeping required to manage a Village Savings and Loans Association is quite simple and most groups successfully become independent within a year and enjoy a high rate of long-term group survival.&#91;24&#93; CARE has created over 40,000 Village Savings and Loans Associations (over 1 million members total) across Africa, Asia, and Latin America&#91;23&#93; and in 2008 launched Access Africa which aims to extend Village Savings and Loans Association training to 39 African countries by 2018.&#91;25&#93;<br/>The model has also been widely replicated in Africa and Asia and by other large NGOs including Oxfam, Plan International, and Catholic Relief Services.&#91;26&#93;<br/>CARE UK later launched lendwithcare.org, which allows members of the public to make microloans, including green loans, to entrepreneurs in Africa and Asia. It avoids many of the criticisms levelled at Kiva.org.<br/>Acronym redefinition and 50th anniversary<br/>In 1993 CARE, to reflect its international organizational structure, changed the meaning of its acronym for a third time, adopting its current name the \"Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere\". CARE also marked its 50th anniversary in 1994.&#91;13&#93;<br/>CARE expanded the confederation to twelve members in the early 2000s, with CARE Netherlands (formerly the Disaster Relief Agency) joining in 2001&#91;27&#93; and CARE Thailand (called the Raks Thai Foundation) joining in 2003, becoming the first CARE National Member in a developing country.&#91;28&#93;<br/>CARE's well-known \"I am Powerful\" campaign launched in the USA in September 2006 and was intended to bring public attention to the organization's long-standing focus on women's empowerment.&#91;13&#93; CARE states that its programs focus on women and girls both because the world's poor are disproportionately female and because women's empowerment is thought to be an important driver of development. CARE also emphasizes that it considers working with boys and men an important part of women's empowerment, and that women's empowerment benefits both genders.&#91;2&#93;<br/>In 2007 CARE announced that by 2009 it would no longer accept certain types of US food aid worth some $45 million a year, arguing that these types of food aid are inefficient and harmful to local markets.&#91;29&#93;&#91;30&#93; Specifically, CARE announced that it would forego all monetized food aid (surplus US food shipped to charities in the developing world who then sell the food on the local market to finance development projects)&#91;30&#93; and all food aid intended to establish a commercial advantage for the donor, and would increase its commitment to buying food aid locally.&#91;31&#93; CARE also announced that it would no longer accept USDA food through Title 1 (concessional sales) or Section 416 (surplus disposal) because these programs are intended mainly to establish a commercial advantage for US agriculture.&#91;31&#93;<br/>In 2011 CARE added its first affiliate member, CARE India, and in 2012 the CI board accepted CARE Peru as CARE's second affiliate member.&#91;2&#93; CARE India became a full member in November 2013. The CI board accepted CARE Peru as a full member of the confederation in June 2015.<br/>CARE is currently one of the only major NGOs to make their database of project evaluations publicly available, and to regularly conduct a meta-analysis of evaluation methodologies and overall organizational impact.&#91;32&#93;&#91;33&#93;<br/>CARE&#8217;s structure<br/>CARE International is a confederation of fourteen CARE National Members, coordinated by the CARE International Secretariat. The Secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland, with offices in New York and in Brussels in order to liaise with the United Nations and the European institutions respectively.&#91;34&#93;<br/>Each CARE National Member is an autonomous non-governmental organization registered in the country, and each Member runs programs, fundraising, and communications activities both in its own country and in developing countries where CARE operates. There are fourteen National Members.

Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.&#91;7&#93;<br/>Career<br/>Schwab was professor of business policy at the University of Geneva from 1972 to 2003, and since then, has been an Honorary Professor there.&#91;8&#93; Since 1979, he has published the Global Competitiveness Report, an annual report assessing the potential for increasing productivity and economic growth of countries around the world, written by a team of economists.&#91;9&#93; The report is based on a methodology developed by Schwab, measuring competitiveness not only in terms of productivity but also based on sustainability criteria.&#91;10&#93;<br/>He has authored and co-authored several books, including The Fourth Industrial Revolution (2016),&#91;11&#93; Shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution (2018, with Nicholas Davis),&#91;12&#93; COVID-19: The Great Reset (2020, with Thierry Malleret),&#91;13&#93; and Stakeholder Capitalism (to appear in 2021, with Peter Vanham).&#91;14&#93;<br/>WEF and other foundations<br/>Schwab has had a life-long gift for building successful nonprofit foundations. In 1971, Schwab founded the European Management Forum,&#91;15&#93; which in 1987 became the World Economic Forum, as a not-for-profit foundation committed to improving the state of the world. He founded the WEF in 1971, the same year in which he published Moderne Unternehmensf&#252;hrung im Maschinenbau&#91;16&#93; (Modern Enterprise Management in Mechanical Engineering). In that book, he argued that the management of a modern enterprise must serve not only shareholders but all stakeholders (die Interessenten), to achieve long-term growth and prosperity. Schwab has championed the multistakeholder concept since the WEF&#8217;s inception. In 2015, the WEF was formally recognised by the Swiss Government as an \"international body\".&#91;17&#93; Under Schwab's management, the WEF has been keen to promote its image as a driver for reconciliation efforts in different parts of the world, acting as a catalyst of numerous collaborations and international initiatives.<br/>In 1998, Schwab and his wife founded the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, another NGO based in Geneva, Switzerland.<br/>In 2004, Schwab created a new foundation using the US$1 million prize money from the Dan David Prize he received that year from Israel. The Forum of Young Global Leaders aims to create a dynamic global community of exceptional people (under 40) with the vision, courage and influence to drive positive change in the world.&#91;18&#93;<br/>In 2011, he founded the Global Shapers Community, a global network of local communities, or \"hubs\", of young people aged 20 to 30 who are exceptional in their potential, achievements and drive to make a contribute to their communities.

WIELER<br/>President, Robert Koch Institute, Germany<br/>Prof. Lothar H. Wieler is the president of the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, the national public health institute in Germany. <br/>His research focusses on zoonotic diseases in a One health concept, i.e. infections that are passed between animals and humans, and account for many of the newly (re-)emerging infectious diseases. A particular research interest of Prof. Wieler are the molecular mechanisms, which enable bacterial zoonotic pathogens such as e. coli and s. aureus to infect different hosts, and develop resistance to antibiotics. In his work, Wieler has used genome-based typing methods to identify zoonotic pathogens, which were subsequently analyzed in functional experiments in order to learn more about their evolution and adaptation to different habitats. The insights generated from this work can be used to develop new interventions to target pathogenic bacteria.<br/>Wieler published more than 250 scientific publications and was awarded several scientific prices. He is co-founder of the German national research platform on zoonoses, and deputy spokesperson for the research consortium InfectControl 2020, which pursues intersectoral approaches to preventing and treating infections from a One Health perspective. Within InfectControl 2020, Wieler also heads the IRMRESS and Neobiom networks. IRMRESS researches innovative strategies to fight mult-drug resistant bacteria and aims to use next generation sequencing techniques to establish a molecular surveillance system. Neobiom identifies factors that change the microbiome, resistome and mykobiome of premature babies. Prof. Wieler is also a member of the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards (STAG-IH) of the World Health Organisation, the scientific advisory board of the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) and the WHO Europe Advisory Committee on Health Research (EACHR). Since 2010, he is also an elected member of the German National Academy of Sciences, where he also holds the position of a senator. As an honorary professor with teaching responsibility, he continues to be associated with the Institute of Microbiology and Epizootics at the Department of Veterinary Medicine at Freie Universit&#228;t Berlin.<br/>Source: <a href=\"https://ianphi.org/about/executive-board.html\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://ianphi.org/about/executive-board.html</a>"},{"id":308,"title":"Suraya Dalil","group":"Person","image":"img/Suraya_Dalil.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://improvingphc.org/our-team\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://improvingphc.org/our-team</a><br/><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suraya_Dalil\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suraya_Dalil</a><br/>Suraya Dalil<br/>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>Jump to navigationJump to search<br/>Suraya Dalil<br/>&#1579;&#1585;&#1740;&#1575; &#1583;&#1604;&#1740;&#1604;<br/>Suraya Dalil - 2017 (23660803992) (cropped).jpg<br/>Suraya Dalil in 2017<br/>Personal details<br/>Citizenship&#9;Afghanistan<br/>Nationality&#9;Afghanistan<br/>Occupation&#9;Physician<br/>Ethnicity&#9;Uzbek<br/>Suraya Dalil (Uzbek/Dari: &#1579;&#1585;&#1740;&#1575; &#1583;&#1604;&#1740;&#1604;&#8206;), (born 1970) is an Afghan physician and politician who served as Minister of Public Health from 2010 to 2014 and has been the country's Permanent Representative to the United Nations since November 2015.<br/>Contents<br/>1&#9;Early life and education<br/>2&#9;Career<br/>3&#9;Other activities<br/>4&#9;Awards and honours<br/>5&#9;Selected publications<br/>6&#9;Personal life<br/>7&#9;References<br/>8&#9;External links<br/>Early life and education<br/>Dalil was born in Kabul in February 1970.

We believe that by working together impact can be realised faster.<br/>The &#8220;Innovation for Impact in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)&#8221; flagship focuses on the journey of patients with infectious disease through the health system, and the portfolio has two parts.

Secondly, improving how the most severely affected patients receive critical care in the LMIC setting. For critical care we don&#8217;t want to copy and paste the high resource model used in high income countries, but rather want to identify context appropriate solutions that work for LMICs. To have a meaningful impact we have focused on tools that can help identify patients who need critical care and improving the quality of critical care these patients receive.<br/>The VITAL project fits with both aims of our critical care portfolio. The team are developing and testing the utility of wearable devices to identify those who may need critical care, using data from patients with different infectious diseases to help support critical care clinical decision making in the Vietnamese ICU setting and developing and testing a new device to support ICU rehabilitation.

Two recently emerged human betacoronaviruses, the group 2b severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the group i2c Human Betacoronavirus 2c EMG/2012 (HCoV SAI) emerged suddenly from bats to produce either a global outbreak or sporadic cases of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with high mortality in human populations. While SARS-CoV is a category C select agent, both viruses encode a single-stranded positive polarity RNA genome of about 30,000 nucleotides in length, which encode for about 29 viral proteins, including several completely unique accessory ORFs that may contribute to in vivo pathogenesis. Importantly, coronaviruses encode a variety of unknown and hypothetical ORFs as well as noncoding RNAs and miRNAs. We test the hypothesis that subsets of these novel genes play critical roles in regulating virus replication efficiency and in vivo pathogenesis. To address this hypothesis, the proposal takes advantage of novel expression vector platfomis, synthetic gene design, reverse genetics, animal models of human disease, and a defined set of biochemical and immunologic assays to identify, characterize and then determine their role in SARS-CoV, EMC-1 and select ancestral bat coronaviruses in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that these viral genes function antagonize/modulate the host intracellular milieu to enhance virus replication, most likely be altering p53, innate immune sensing, inflammasome, apoptosis orTLR signaling.<br/>In Aim 1, we characterize the expression, subcellular localization and function as an antaogonist or agonist of antiviral defense signaling networks. In Aiim 2, we isolate recombinant virus and study the function of these uncharacterized genes in virus replication and host cell antiviral defense signaling networks.<br/>In Aim 3, we study the pathogenesis of recombinant viruses lacking unknown and hypothetical ORFs and noncoding RNAs using young and aged animal models of human disease.<br/>Public Health Relevance<br/>Coronaviruses are important human pathogens and encode novel genes that antagonize host antiviral defense pathways. By identifying the mechanisms of antagonism and the host targets, our studies will reveal novel therapeutic targets for disease control and new strategies to attenuate coronaviruses, protecting the global health from future outbreaks of disease."},{"id":350,"title":"U19 AI100625 Systems Immunogenetics of Biodefense and Emerging Pathogens in the Collaborative Cross","group":"Document","image":"img/document.png","value":1,"notes":"<br/>Systems Immunogenetics of Biodefense and Emerging Pathogens in the Collaborative Cross<br/>Baric, Ralph S.

Host immune responses can play either protective or a pathologic role during viral infections. Therefore, understanding of the regulatory networks and signaling pathways that determine the magnitude and quality of an individual's antiviral immune response has important implications for human health, since these genes/pathways could be therapeutically targeted to treat virus- induced disease, or may represent targets for enhancing the safety and efficacy of vaccines against a wide range of viral pathogens. Polymorphic host genes and regulatory networks have a major impact on immune response variation in human populations. However, confounding environmental factors and/or ethical concerns limit the types of studies that can be conducted in humans. Therefore, genetically tractable model systems that capture the range of genetic and phenotypic diversity seen in humans, such as the Collaborative Cross (CC) are needed to mechanistically dissect the genetics of immune variation. Our research team has quantified variation in baseline, as well as SARS-CoV, IAV, and WNV-induced immune responses in a panel of 110 CC RIX lines (reproducible F1 crosses between CC recombinant inbred (RI) lines that model heterozygous human populations). To our knowledge, this represents to most comprehensive analysis of immune response variation ever conducted in a genetic reference population, and in ongoing QTL mapping studies, we have identified 100+ quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with variation in virus-induced innate and adaptive immunity, inflammation and disease. Our program, which includes expertise in viral pathogenesis, innate and adaptive immunity, and quantitative genetics will use this unprecedented data base to: 1) identify and characterize polymorphic host genes that drive variation in virus-induced disease, 2) test how interactions between different polymorphic genes/loci shape the host immune response, 3) test how these genes impact responses to other viral pathogens, or function during allergy/auto-immunity, and 4) test the impact of these genes in the context of human infections to identify targets for diagnosis, prevention and therapeutic interventions in humans. These studies will significantly enhance our understanding of how host genetic variation shapes virus-induced immunity and/or disease.<br/>Public Health Relevance<br/>Host genetic variation has a major impact on virus-induced immunity, and the proposed studies will utilize the Collaborative Cross and Human cohorts to understand how host genetic variation impacts virus-induced immunity and disease.<br/>  Funding Agency<br/>Agency<br/>National Institute of Health (NIH)<br/>Institute<br/>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)<br/>Type<br/>Research Program--Cooperative Agreements (U19)<br/>Project #<br/>5U19AI100625-08<br/>Application #<br/>9767647<br/>Study Section<br/>Special Emphasis Panel (ZAI1)<br/>Program Officer<br/>Liu, Qian<br/>Project Start<br/>2012-08-05<br/>Project End<br/>2022-08-31<br/>Budget Start<br/>2019-09-01<br/>Budget End<br/>2020-08-31<br/>Support Year<br/>8<br/>Fiscal Year<br/>2019<br/>Total Cost<br/>Indirect Cost<br/>"},{"id":351,"title":"Patent # 7618802 - Compositions of coronaviruses with a recombination-resistant genome","group":"Document","image":"img/document.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://patents.justia.com/patent/7618802\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://patents.justia.com/patent/7618802</a><br/>Compositions of coronaviruses with a recombination-resistant genome<br/>Jan 19, 2006 - The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill<br/>The present invention provides a cDNA of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, recombinant SARS coronavirus vectors, and SARS coronavirus replicon particles.

The United States Government has certain rights to this invention.<br/>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br/>The present invention relates to compositions of infectious cDNA of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, recombinant SARS coronavirus vectors. SARS coronavirus replicon particles, methods of making the compositions of this invention and methods of using the compositions as immunogens and/or vaccines and/or to express heterologous nucleic acids.<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br/>Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a life-threatening respiratory disease that probably originated in Guangdong Province, China in the fall of 2002 &#91;1, 2&#93;. The agent responsible for the disease spread rapidly &#91;3,4&#93;. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), isolated from febrile and dying patients, is the etiologic agent responsible for the disease &#91;5-8&#93;. SARS-CoV infection is associated with overall case fatality rates thought to approach &#732;14-15%, with selected populations being at increased risk (>50% in the elderly). SARS-CoV has infected over 8,000 individuals worldwide and caused over 800 deaths, before aggressive infection control measures successfully contained the scope of the outbreak. Despite intensive efforts, no effective antiviral treatments against SARS have been described.<br/>Coronaviruses, members of the order Nidovirus, contain the largest single-stranded, positive-polarity RNA genome in nature and are divided into three main serogroups; group I: transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCV-229E), group II: mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BoCV), and group III: infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Sequence analyses suggest that SARS-CoV represents the prototype strain of group IV &#91;6, 8-10&#93;. The SARS-CoV genomic RNA is &#732;29,700 base pairs in length and has several large open reading frames (ORFs) encoded in subgenomic and full-length mRNAs &#91;8-10&#93;. The subgenomic mRNAs are arranged in the form of a nested set from the 3 proximal end, and leader RNA sequences, encoded at the 5&#8242; end of the genome, are joined to body sequences at a highly conserved consensus sequence (CS) located just upstream of each of the ORFs. The exact SARS CS sequence has been reported as either CUAAAC or AAACGAAC by different laboratories &#91;8,9&#93;. The SARS-CoV genome length RNA is likely packaged by a 50-kDa-nucleocapsid protein (N) &#91;8&#93;. As with other coronaviruses, the virion contains several viral structural proteins including the &#732;140 kDa spike glycoprotein (S), a 23 kDa membrane glycoprotein (M) and a &#732;10 kDa protein (E).<br/>The coronavirus gene 1, or replicase gene, comprises two-thirds of the genome. MHV contains two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, which are connected by a ribosomal frameshift structure. In MHV, three proteinases, papain-like proteinases 1 and 2 (PLP-1, PLP-2) &#91;11-13&#93; and 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) &#91;14&#93;, are expressed as part of the replicase gene polyprotein and mediate cleavage of the polyproteins into at least 15 mature proteins. Continuous protein processing is crucial for ongoing virus transcription so MHV replication is sensitive to protease inhibitors that prevent replicase processing &#91;11&#93;. Additional functions have been predicted for proteins processed from the replicase polyprotein, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (pol), an RNA helicase (hel) and a capping enzymatic activity &#91;6, 15, 16&#93;. The SARS virus replicase gene is similarly organized except that the SARS virus replicase has been predicted to encode only the PLP-2 equivalent and the 3CLpro proteases &#91;6, 7&#93;.<br/>The present invention provides a full length cDNA of the SARS coronavirus, from which transcripts are produced that replicate and/or are infectious in vitro or in vivo, multiplication-defective replicon vector particles produced from the cDNA and methods of making and using these compositions as immunogens, vaccines and/or nucleic acid delivery vectors.<br/>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br/>FIGS. 1A-B. Leader body TRS junctions in wild type and chimeric recombinant viruses. Leader-containing cDNAs were isolated, subcloned and sequenced as described. The expected leader body junctions were noted for icSARS-CoV (SEQ ID NO:77) and icSARS-CoV CRG (SEQ ID NOS:78 and 79), using the body TRS CS junctions ACGAAG and CCGGAT. Leader containing transcripts were analyzed for M, and ORF3a-encoding mRNAs. Panel A: Leader-body junctions in ORF3a-encoding mRNAs. Panel B: Leader-containing junctions in ORF M-encoding mRNAs.<br/>FIG. 2. Mechanism of secondary genetic trap. In the recombinant virus, there is miscommunication between the leader TRS CS and the body TRS CS. In this example, subgenomic transcripts of the essential S gene are directed to initiate within the S gene, resulting in N terminal truncations in the S glycoprotein product. Similar mutations can be introduced in the essential M and N structural protein genes.<br/>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br/>The present invention provides a cDNA of the SARS coronavirus, from which transcripts are produced that replicate and/or are infectious in vitro or in vivo.

Thus, the present invention includes the embodiment of a helper cell comprising a helper RNA encoding at least one coronavirus structural protein and the embodiment of a helper cell comprising a SARS coronavirus replicon RNA comprising a coronavirus packaging signal and a heterologous RNA sequence, wherein said replicon RNA lacks a sequence encoding at least one coronavirus structural protein.<br/>The present invention additionally provides a method of making infectious, multiplication-defective, coronavirus particles, comprising: a) providing the helper cell of this invention; and b) producing coronavirus particles in the helper cell.<br/>The foregoing and other objects and aspects of the present invention are explained in detail in the specification set forth below.<br/>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br/>As used herein, &#8220;a&#8221; or &#8220;an&#8221; or &#8220;the&#8221; can mean one or more than one. For example, &#8220;a&#8221; cell can mean one cell or a plurality of cells.<br/>Also as used herein, &#8220;and/or&#8221; refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items, as well as the lack of combinations when interpreted in the alternative (&#8220;or&#8221;).<br/>Furthermore, the term &#8220;about,&#8221; as used herein when referring to a measurable value such as an amount of a compound or agent of this invention, dose, time, temperature, and the like, is meant to encompass variations of &#177;20%, &#177;10%, &#177;5%, &#177;1%, &#177;0.5%, or even &#177;0.1% of the specified amount.<br/>As used herein, the transitional phrase &#8220;consisting essentially of&#8221; means that the scope of a claim is to be interpreted to encompass the specified materials or steps recited in the claim, &#8220;and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s)&#8221; of the claimed invention. See, In re Herz, 537 F.2d 549, 551-52, 190 USPQ 461, 463 (CCPA 1976) (emphasis in the original); see also MPEP &#167; 2111.03.<br/>&#8220;Nidovirus&#8221; as used herein refers to viruses within the order Nidovirales, including the families Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae. All viruses within the order Nidovirales share the unique feature of synthesizing a nested set of multiple subgenomic mRNAs. See M. Lai and K. Holmes, Coronaviridae: The Viruses and Their Replication, in Fields Virology, pg 1163, (4th Ed. 2001). Particular examples of Coronaviridae include, but are not limited to, toroviruses and coronaviruses.<br/>&#8220;Coronavirus&#8221; as used herein refers to a genus in the family Coronaviridae, which family is in turn classified within the order Nidovirales. The coronaviruses are large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses. They have the largest genomes of all RNA viruses and replicate by a unique mechanism that results in a high frequency of recombination. The coronaviruses include antigenic groups I, II, and III. While the present invention is described primarily with respect to SARS coronavirus, the invention may be carried out with any coronavirus, such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human respiratory coronavirus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, canine coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, rabbit coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus, sialodacryoadenitis virus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, bovine coronavirus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, and turkey coronavirus, as well as chimeras of any of the foregoing. See generally M. Lai and K. Holmes, &#8220;Coronaviridae: The Viruses and Their Replication,&#8221; in Fields Virology, (4th Ed. 2001).<br/>A &#8220;nidovirus permissive cell&#8221; or &#8220;coronavirus permissive cell&#8221; as used herein can be any cell in which a coronavirus can at least replicate, including both naturally occurring and recombinant cells. In some embodiments the permissive cell is also one that the nidovirus or coronavirus can infect. The permissive cell can be one that has been modified by recombinant means to produce a cell surface receptor for the nidovirus or coronavirus.<br/>A &#8220;heterologous RNA&#8221; as described herein can encode any protein, peptide, antisense sequence, ribozyme, etc., to be administered to a subject of this invention for any purpose. For example, the heterologous RNA can encode, and be expressed in the subject to produce, a protein or peptide. The protein or peptide may, for example, be an antigen or immunogen in embodiments where it is desired to produce antibodies in an animal subject, which antibodies can be collected and used for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes, or where it is desired to elicit an immune response to the protein or peptide in a subject.<br/>A &#8220;structural protein&#8221; as used herein refers to a protein required for production of coronavirus particles of this invention, such as those encoded by the S, E, M and N genes, as well as any other structural proteins now known or later identified in the coronavirus and in particular in the SARS virus genome. In embodiments of this invention wherein the replicon RNA and/or helper RNAs lack a nucleotide sequence encoding a structural protein, the nucleotide sequence can be wholly or partly deleted, or the sequence can be present but in a mutated form, so that the net effect is that the replicon RNA and/or the helper RNA is effectively incapable of producing the necessary structural protein in functional form. Thus, for example, in an embodiment that recites a replicon RNA or helper RNA that &#8220;lacks a sequence encoding at least one coronavirus structural protein,&#8221; it is meant that the nucleotide sequence encoding the at least one coronavirus structural protein is deleted completely or in part from the replicon RNA or helper RNA or it is meant that the nucleotide sequence encoding the at least one coronavirus structural protein is present on the replicon RNA or helper RNA but in a form (e.g., mutated or otherwise altered) that cannot be expressed to produce a functional protein.<br/>&#8220;Multiplication-defective&#8221; or &#8220;replication-defective&#8221; as used herein means that the replicon RNA contained within viral particles produced according to the present invention does not itself contain sufficient genetic information to allow for the production of new infectious viral particles.<br/>As noted above, the present invention is based on the discovery of a full-length cDNA of the SARS coronavirus. As used herein, a &#8220;cDNA of a SARS coronavirus&#8221; or &#8220;infectious cDNA of a SARS coronavirus&#8221; is a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of a SARS coronavirus, from which RNA transcripts are produced that replicate and/or are infectious in vitro or in vivo. A SARS coronavirus cDNA of this invention can encode the sequence of any SARS coronavirus isolate now known or later identified. The genomic sequences of some of the known SARS coronavirus isolates are set forth in Genbank and assigned Accession numbers AY278741 (SEQ ID NO:2, provided herein), AY274119, AY278554 and AY278554 and the entire contents of each of these sequences are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties as embodiments of this invention. (See also Rota et al. (2003) Science 300:1394; Marra et al. (2003) Science 300:1399; the entire contents of each of which are incorporated by reference herein for the teachings of the identification and characterization of the genomic sequence of a SARS coronavirus).<br/>Two examples of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a cDNA of this invention are provided in the attached Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:3. As this invention encompasses all such cDNAs of all SARS coronavirus isolates, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an isolated nucleic acid comprising, consisting of and/or consisting essentially of, a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of: a) SEQ ID NO:1 and/or SEQ ID NO:3 or a fragment of at least 25 contiguous nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO:1 and/or SEQ ID NO:3; b) a nucleotide sequence that is functionally equivalent to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 and/or SEQ ID NO:3 but comprises different codons encoding the same amino acid sequences; c) a nucleotide sequence having at least 70% homology to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 and/or SEQ ID NO:3; d) a nucleotide sequence having at least 95% homology to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 and/or SEQ ID NO:3; e) a nucleotide sequence that hybridizes to the complement of SEQ ID NO:1 and/or SEQ ID NO:3 under stringent conditions; and f) a nucleotide sequence having complementarity (e.g., partial or complete) to any of the nucleotide sequences of (a)-(e) above.<br/>The present invention further provides nucleic acid molecules comprising, consisting of and/or consisting essentially of, a fragment of at least 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 950 or 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000, 26,000, 27,000, 28,000, 29,000, 29,500, etc. contiguous nucleotides (including any values within this range not specifically recited herein, e.g., 56 nucleotides or 6345 nucleotides) of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, or a complement thereof. A fragment of this invention can be a fragment that hybridizes to a sequence that is unique to the cDNA of this invention. The production, identification and characterization of such fragments for desired properties as described herein is carried out according to protocols well known in the art.<br/>An &#8220;isolated&#8221; nucleic acid molecule is one that is chemically synthesized (e.g., derived from reverse transcription) or is separated from other nucleic acid molecules that are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid molecule. Preferably, an &#8220;isolated&#8221; nucleic acid molecule is free of sequences (preferably protein encoding sequences) that naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kB, 4 kB, 3 kB, 2 kB, 1 kB, 0.5 kB or 0.1 kB of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an &#8220;isolated&#8221; nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. (e.g., as described in Sambrook et al., eds., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989).<br/>In another embodiment of this invention, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention comprises a nucleic acid molecule that is a complement of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or a fragment thereof. A nucleic acid molecule which is complementary to a given nucleotide sequence is one which is sufficiently complementary to the given nucleotide sequence that it can hybridize to the given nucleotide sequence under conditions described herein, thereby forming a stable duplex.<br/>The invention further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 due to degeneracy of the genetic code and thus encode the same proteins as those encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1.<br/>In particular embodiments, a nucleic acid of this invention has at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or more nucleic acid sequence homology with the sequences specifically disclosed herein. The term &#8220;homology&#8221; as used herein refers to a degree of similarity between two or more sequences. There can be partial homology or complete homology (i.e., identity). A partially homologous sequence that at least partially inhibits an identical sequence from hybridizing to a target nucleic acid is referred to using the functional term &#8220;substantially homologous.&#8221; The inhibition of hybridization to the target sequence can be examined using a hybridization assay (Southern or northern blot, solution hybridization and the like) under conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or hybridization probe will compete for and inhibit the binding of a completely homologous sequence to the target sequence under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective) interaction. The absence of non-specific binding can be tested by the use of a second target sequence, which lacks even a partial degree of complementarity (e.g. less than about 30% identity). In the absence of non-specific binding, the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target sequence.<br/>Alternatively stated, in particular embodiments, nucleic acids encoding a cDNA of a SARS coronavirus that hybridize under the conditions described herein to the complement of the sequences specifically disclosed herein can also be used according to the present invention. The term &#8220;hybridization&#8221; as used herein refers to any process by which a first strand of nucleic acid binds with a second strand of nucleic acid through base pairing.<br/>The term &#8220;stringent&#8221; as used here refers to hybridization conditions that are commonly understood in the art to define the commodities of the hybridization procedure. High stringency hybridization conditions that will permit homologous nucleotide sequences to hybridize to a nucleotide sequence as given herein are well known in the art. As one example, hybridization of such sequences to the nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein can be carried out in 25% formamide, 5&#215;SSC, 5&#215;Denhardt's solution and 5% dextran sulfate at 42&#176; C., with wash conditions of 25% formamide, 5&#215;SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42&#176; C., to allow hybridization of sequences of about 60% homology. Another example includes hybridization conditions of 6&#215;SSC, 0.1% SDS at about 45&#176; C., followed by wash conditions of 0.2&#215;SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50-65&#176; C. Another example of stringent conditions is represented by a wash stringency of 0.3 M NaCl, 0.03M sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS at 60-70&#176; C. using a standard hybridization assay (see SAMBROOK et al., EDS., MOLECULAR CLONING: A LABORATORY MANUAL 2d ed. (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. 1989, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein).<br/>As is known in the art, a number of different programs can be used to identify whether a nucleic acid or amino acid has sequence identity or similarity to a known sequence. Sequence identity or similarity may be determined using standard techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, the local sequence identity algorithm of Smith & Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2, 482 (1981), by the sequence identity alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48,443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85,2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis.), the Best Fit sequence program described by Devereux et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 12, 387-395 (1984), preferably using the default settings, or by inspection.<br/>An example of a useful algorithm is PILEUP. PILEUP creates a multiple sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive, pairwise alignments. It can also plot a tree showing the clustering relationships used to create the alignment. PILEUP uses a simplification of the progressive alignment method of Feng & Doolittle, J. Mol. Evol. 35, 351-360 (1987); the method is similar to that described by Higgins & Sharp, CABIOS 5, 151-153 (1989).<br/>Another example of a useful algorithm is the BLAST algorithm, described in Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215, 403-410, (1990) and Karlin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 5873-5787 (1993). A particularly useful BLAST program is the WU-BLAST-2 program that was obtained from Altschul et al., Methods in Enzymology, 266, 460-480 (1996). WU-BLAST-2 uses several search parameters, which are preferably set to the default values. The parameters are dynamic values and are established by the program itself depending upon the composition of the particular sequence and composition of the particular database against which the sequence of interest is being searched; however, the values may be adjusted to increase sensitivity. An additional useful algorithm is gapped BLAST as reported by Altschul et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 25, 3389-3402.<br/>The CLUSTAL program can also be used to determine sequence similarity. This algorithm is described by Higgins et al. (1988) Gene 73:237; Higgins et al. (1989) CABIOS 5:151-153; Corpet et al. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16: 10881-90; Huang et al. (1992) CABIOS 8: 155-65; and Pearson et al. (1994) Meth. Mol. Biol. 24: 307-331.<br/>The alignment may include the introduction of gaps in the sequences to be aligned. In addition, for sequences that contain either more or fewer nucleotides than the nucleic acids disclosed herein, it is understood that in one embodiment, the percentage of sequence identity will be determined based on the number of identical nucleotides in relation to the total number of nucleotide bases. Thus, for example, sequence identity of sequences shorter than a sequence specifically disclosed herein will be determined using the number of nucleotide bases in the shorter sequence, in one embodiment. In percent identity calculations, relative weight is not assigned to various manifestations of sequence variation, such as, insertions, deletions, substitutions, etc.<br/>In certain embodiments of this invention, the nucleic acid of this invention can comprise a promoter that directs the production of an RNA transcript from the cDNA.

Methods of detecting replication competent particles by passage on cell culture are standard in the art. These assays can also be carried out by passage of the replicon particles of this invention on cells constitutively expressing nucleic acid encoding the missing coronavirus structural protein(s), with the expected result of obtaining replication competent coronavirus particles.<br/>It is also contemplated that the replicon RNA and/or replicon particles of this invention can comprise coronavirus RNA and/or structural proteins that comprise any or all of the gene order rearrangements, deletions and/or mutations described herein that can be present in the SARS coronavirus cDNA of this invention.<br/>Another aspect of the present invention is a renetworked or rewired nidovirus genome and/or replicon RNA that results in a genetic trap for wild type viruses should recombination occur, e.g., when the genome or replicon RNA is contacted with wild type virus. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an isolated nucleic acid comprising, consisting essentially of and/or consisting of a nucleotide sequence encoding a Nidovirus genome or replicon RNA, wherein the genome or replicon RNA comprises, consists essentially of and/or consists of one or more of the same mutations in a consensus sequence (CS) present in a transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) of a leader sequence and in the TRS located upstream of each of the structural genes and further wherein wild type CS sequences are present in the CS of the TRS for the group specific ORFs 3a/b, ORF4, ORF5, ORF6, ORF7a/b, ORF8a/b and ORF9a/b. This remodeled genome or replicon RNA can be considered to be partially remodeled (e.g., PRG). Other mutations in the genome or replicon RNA may or may not be present, provided such other mutants do not affect the genetic trap function of the rewired (e.g., mutated) CSs.<br/>Further provided herein is an isolated nucleic acid comprising, consisting essentially of and/or consisting of a nucleotide sequence encoding a Nidovirus genome or replicon RNA, wherein the genome or replicon RNA comprises, consists essentially of and/or consists of one or more of the same mutations in a consensus sequence (CS) present in a transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) of a leader sequence and in the TRS located upstream of each of the structural genes and further comprising one or more of the same mutations in the CS of the TRS located upstream of open reading frame (ORF) 3a/3b, ORF 4, ORF 5, ORF6, ORF 7a/7b, ORF 8a/b and ORF 9a/b and downstream of the leader RNA. This remodeled genome or replicon RNA can be considered to be completely remodeled (e.g., CRG). Other mutations in the genome or replicon RNA may or may not be present, provided such other mutants do not affect the genetic trap function of the rewired (e.g., mutated) CSs.<br/>The isolated nucleic acids described herein can be from a Nidovirus that is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus having the CS of ACGAAC. In this embodiment, the mutation can be a single mutation in the CS sites (e.g., ACGGAC, etc.), two mutations in the CS sites (e.g., ACGGAT, CCGGAC, CCGAAT, etc.), three mutations in the CS sites (e.g., CCGGAT, CCGCGC, CGCAAC, etc.), four mutations in the CS sites (e.g., CCCGAT, AGCGAT, etc.), five mutations in the CS sites (CGCGAT, CCCGTT, etc.) and six mutations in the CS sites (CGCGTT, TGCGGT, etc.). It is contemplated in this invention and applicants are in possession of the embodiment wherein the CS sequence is mutated according to any one of 46 possible combinations of sequence variations, which combinations can be readily calculated and identified according to methods standard in the art. Factors governing site selection for mutation are based on 1) a unique sequence element that is not repeated elsewhere in the genome and 2) a mutant CS that functions as a regulatory start site when coupled with compensating changes at the leader CS site. Thus, the mutation(s) can be any possible combination of changes in the body CSs and in the leader CS and a particular mutation or combination of mutations is not critical as long as the same mutations are present in the body CSs as in the leader CS. In other words, the actual mutant CS sequence is not critical, the major factor being that CS sites must allow for communication via efficient base-pairing for discontinuous transcription of subgenomic RNAs, thus the same mutation(s) is present in the leader CS as in the body CS(s).<br/>In further embodiments, the Nidovirus of this invention can be a group I coronavirus having the CS of CUAAAC and the mutation can be a single mutation (e.g., GUAAAC, etc.), two mutations (e.g., GCAAAC, etc.), three mutations (e.g., CGAAAG, etc.), four mutations (e.g., GCTAAAG, etc.), five mutations (e.g., GCTTAG. etc.) and/or six mutations (GCTTGG, etc.). It is contemplated as part of this invention and applicants are in possession of a total of 46 possible combinations of sequence variation in the CS of this invention, as could be identified and produced according to standard methods. Factors to consider in selecting mutations include whether the mutation(s) are unique and able to interact with an identical leader CS site to drive expression of subgenomic mRNAs.<br/>The Nidovirus of this invention can also be a group II coronavirus having the CS of TCTAAAC and the mutation can be a single mutation (e.g., CCTAAAC, etc.), two mutations (e.g., CCGAAAC, etc.), three mutations (e.g., CGTAAAG, etc.), four mutations (e.g., CCGAAGG, etc.), five mutations (e.g., CGTCCGC, etc), six mutations (e.g., CGGATTG, etc) and/or seven mutations (e.g., CGGCCTG, etc). It is contemplated as part of this invention and applicants are in possession of a total of 47 possible combinations of sequence variation in the CS of this invention, as could be identified and produced according to standard methods. As noted herein for other nidoviruses, the principle requirements for mutation selection are that the sequence not be located elsewhere in the genome and that it function to regulate subgenomic transcription when paired with a leader TRS of like sequence.<br/>In yet further embodiments, the Nidovirus of this invention can be a group III coronavirus having the CS of CUUAACAA and the mutation can be a single mutation (e.g., CUUAAGAA, etc.) two mutations (e.g., GUUAAGAA, etc.) three mutations (GUUGAGAA, etc.), four mutations (e.g., GUUTTCAG, five mutations (e.g., CAAGGCAA, TCCAAGAT, etc.), six mutations (e.g., GUUCCTTC, etc.), seven mutations (e.g., GCCTAGCG, etc.) and/or eight mutations (e.g., GCCTGGCT, etc.). It is contemplated as part of this invention and applicants are in possession of a total of 48 possible combinations of sequence variation in the CS of this invention, as could be identified and produced according to standard methods.<br/>The present invention further provides an embodiment wherein the Nidovirus is a torovirus having a CS regulatory sequence of UUUAGA and the mutation is a single mutation (e.g., GUUAGA, etc.) two mutations (e.g., GUUGGA, etc.), three mutations (e.g., GUUGCA, etc.), four mutations (e.g., GCUCCA, etc.) five mutations (e.g. GCCACT, etc.) and/or six mutations (e.g., GCCTCT, etc.). It is contemplated as part of this invention and applicants are in possession of a total of 46 possible combinations of sequence variation in the CS of this invention, as could be identified and produced according to standard methods. As noted herein for other nidoviruses, the exact mutation(s) are dependent upon the uniqueness of this sequence in the different Torovirus genome CS regions coupled with its ability to regulate subgenomic transcription via a matching mutation in the leader CS region.<br/>The nidovirus of this invention can also be an arterivirus having a CS of UCNUUAACC, U(A/G)(U/A)AACC, or UUAACC and the mutation can be a single mutation (e.g., CUAACC. etc.) two mutations (e.g., CCAACC, etc.), three mutations (e.g., CCAAGC, etc.) four mutations (e.g., CCAGGC, etc.) five mutations (e.g., CCAGGT, etc.) and/or six mutations (e.g., GGTTAG, etc.), including a cluster of mutations in a six nucleotide segment of these CSs. It is contemplated as part of this invention and applicants are in possession of a total of 49 possible combinations of potential mutant CS sites available for use in this invention. The mutated CS sequence should be unique to that particular arterivirus and able to interact with the identically mutated leader CS site located at the 5&#8242; end of the genome.<br/>The present invention further provides the isolated nucleic acids described herein having all of the body and leader CS sites reengineered by mutation (e.g., CRG), wherein the nucleic acid further comprises a secondary CS trap that is preferentially recognized in RNA recombinant viruses. These secondary CS trap sites are engineered wild type CSs located within a structural protein gene that lead to expression of one or more subgenomic mRNAs that do not encode a full length structural protein when present in a recombinant virus.<br/>Thus, a CRG genome or replicon RNA of this invention can further comprise, consist essentially of and/or consist of a wild type CS engineered within one or more structural protein genes. As one example, the genome or replicon RNA can be of a SARS coronavirus having a wild type CS sequence of ACGAAC. In addition to mutations in the body CSs and leader CS, additional mutations would be introduced into the N, M, E and/or S gene(s) in any combination to provide an artificial CS having the same nucleotide sequence as the wild type CS, ACGAAC. This artificial CS is introduced into the structural gene sequence as described herein in Example 6.<br/>Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an isolated nucleic acid comprising, consisting essentially of and/or consisting of a nucleotide sequence encoding a Nidovirus genome or replicon RNA, wherein the genome or replicon RNA comprises, consists essentially of and/or consists of one or more of the same mutations in a consensus sequence (CS) present in a transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) of a leader sequence and in the TRS located upstream of each of the structural genes and further comprising one or more of the same mutations in the CS of the TRS located upstream of open reading frame (ORF) 3a/3b, ORF 4, ORF 5, ORF6, ORF 7a/7b, ORF 8a/b and ORF 9a/b and downstream of the leader RNA and further comprising one or more than one artificial CS having the nucleotide sequence of the wild type CS of the nidovirus, in one or more of the structural protein genes (e.g., N, M, E and/or S).<br/>Additionally provided is an isolated nucleic acid comprising, consisting essentially of and/or consisting of a nucleotide sequence encoding a Nidovirus genome or replicon RNA, wherein the genome or replicon RNA comprises, consists essentially of and/or consists of one or more of the same mutations in a consensus sequence (CS) present in a transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) of a leader sequence and in the TRS located upstream of each of the structural genes S, E, M and N and further wherein wild type CS sequences are present in the CS of the TRS for the group specific ORFs 3a/b, ORF4, ORF5, ORF6, ORF7a/b, ORF8a/b and ORF9a/b and further comprising one or more than one artificial CS having the nucleotide sequence of the wild type CS of the nidovirus, in one or more of the structural protein genes (e.g., N, M, E and/or S).<br/>The present invention further provides a nidovirus particle as well as a population of nidovirus particles comprising any of the nucleic acids of this invention<br/>The nidovirus and/or nidovirus particle of this invention can be a coronavirus, a torovirus, an arterivirus and chimeras thereof, as are known in the art.<br/>A coronavirus of this invention can be, but is not limited to, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human respiratory coronavirus, human coronavirus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, respiratory bovine virus, canine coronavirus, bat SARS-CoV, human coronavirus NL63, human coronavirus HKU1, human coronavirus OC43, human coronavirus 229E, feline enteric coronavirus, bat coronaviruses, feline infectious peritonitis virus, rabbit coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus, sialodacryoadenitis virus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, bovine coronavirus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, turkey coronavirus, and a chimera of any combination of these viruses.<br/>An arterivirus of this invention can be but is not limited to, equine arteritis virus, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory disease virus, human arteriviruses, and chimeras of any combination of these viruses containing, e.g., replicase protein genes from one arterivirus fused with structural ORFs and group specific ORFs of other arteriviruses.

The most suitable route in any given case will depend, as is well known in the art, on such factors as the species, age, gender and overall condition of the subject, the nature and severity of the condition being treated and/or on the nature of the particular composition (i.e., dosage, formulation) that is being administered.<br/>Subjects to whom the viruses, vectors, particles, populations and/or other compositions of this invention can be administered according to the methods described herein can be any subject, generally vertebrates, for which the particles, populations and/or compositions are infectious, including but not limited to, birds and mammals such as pigs, mice, cows, and humans.<br/>As used herein, an &#8220;effective amount&#8221; refers to an amount of a compound or composition that is sufficient to produce a desired effect, which can be a therapeutic, prophylactic and/or beneficial effect.<br/>Thus, the present invention provides a method of inducing an immune response in a subject, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a virus, vector, particle, population and/or composition of this invention.<br/>The present invention also provides a method of treating and/or preventing a SARS coronavirus infection in a subject, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a virus, vector, particle, population and/or composition of this invention.<br/>Also as used herein, the terms &#8220;treat,&#8221; &#8220;treating&#8221; and &#8220;treatment&#8221; include any type of mechanism, action or activity that results in a change in the medical status of a subject, including an improvement in the condition of the subject (e.g., change or improvement in one or more symptoms and/or clinical parameters), delay in the progression of the condition, prevention or delay of the onset of a disease or illness, etc.<br/>One example of an effective amount is from about 104 to about 1010, preferably 105 to 109, and in particular 106 to 108 infectious units (IU, as measured by indirect immunofluorescence assay), or virus particles, per dose, which can be administered to a subject, depending upon the age, species and/or condition of the subject being treated.<br/>In some embodiments of the present invention, the compositions can be administered with an adjuvant. As used herein, &#8220;adjuvant&#8221; describes a substance, which can be any immunomodulating substance capable of being combined with the polypeptide or nucleic acid vaccine to enhance, improve or otherwise modulate an immune response in a subject without deleterious effect on the subject.<br/>Non-limiting examples of adjuvants that can be used in the vaccine of the present invention include the RIBI adjuvant system (Ribi Inc., Hamilton, Mont.), alum, mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide gel, oil-in-water emulsions, water-in-oil emulsions such as, e.g., Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvants, Block copolymer (CytRx, Atlanta Ga.), QS-21 (Cambridge Biotech Inc., Cambridge Mass.), SAF-M (Chiron, Emeryville Calif.), AMPHIGEN&#8482; adjuvant, saponin, Quil A or other saponin fraction, monophosphoryl lipid A, and Avridine lipid-amine adjuvant. Non-limiting examples of oil-in-water emulsions useful in the vaccine of the invention include modified SEAM62 and SEAM 1/2 formulations. Modified SEAM62 is an oil-in-water emulsion containing 5% (v/v) squalene (Sigma), 1% (v/v) SPAN&#8482; 85 detergent (ICI Surfactants), 0.7% (v/v) TWEEN&#8482; 80 detergent (ICI Surfactants), 2.5% (v/v) ethanol, 200 pg/ml Quil A, 100 &#956;g/ml cholesterol, and 0.5% (v/v) lecithin. Modified SEAM 1/2 is an oil-in-water emulsion comprising 5% (v/v) squalene, 1% (v/v) SPAN 85 detergent, 0.7% (v/v) Tween 80 detergent, 2.5% (v/v) ethanol, 100 &#956;g/ml Quil A, and 50 &#956;g/ml cholesterol. Other immunomodulatory agents that can be included in the vaccine include, e.g., one or more interleukins, interferons, or other known cytokines.<br/>SARS coronavirus vectors also provide a system for the incorporation and expression of one or more heterologous nucleic acids, as coronaviruses contain a polycistronic genome organization and synthesize multiple subgenomic-length mRNAs (Enjuanes and van der Zeijst (1995) In: S. G. Siddell (ed.), The Coronaviridae. Plenum Press, New York, N.Y., p. 337-376).<br/>In certain embodiments, the present invention describes the assembly of recombinant transmissible virus and replicons that express heterologous nucleic acids, which can be used to deliver such nucleic acids and/or make vaccines/immunogenic compositions against homologous and heterologous pathogens (Agapov et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:12989-12994; Balasuriya et al. (2000) J. Virol. 74:10623-10630; Berglund et al. (1998) Nat. Biotechnol. 16:562-565; Bredenbeek et al. (1993) J.

Virol. 74:4394-4403).<br/>The use of replicons as a vaccine delivery system offers a number of important advantages over the use of live, attenuated virus vaccines, which are capable of independent spread and recombination with wild-type virus populations. Replicon vectors are an inherently safer alternative to the use of live, attenuated virus vaccines due to the lack of progeny virus production. In addition, high-level expression of heterologous nucleic acids can result in the use of a relatively low dose of virus replicon particles (VRPs) for vaccination and immune induction. Moreover, gene order rearranged and/or otherwise attenuated replicon particles will be inherently more stable and less pathogenic than attenuated wild-type strains.<br/>Thus, the present invention also provides a method of introducing a heterologous RNA into a subject, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of the particles and/or the populations and/or compositions of this invention comprising these particles or populations. The heterologous RNA can encode any protein or peptide or antisense sequence or ribozyme and can be administered to impart any type of effect (e.g., immunological or therapeutic, etc.).<br/>The production of virus replicon particles is well known in the art for a variety of virus systems, including coronaviruses (see, e.g., Curtis et al. (2002) J. Virol. 76:1422-1434; PCT Publication No. WO 02/086068, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated by reference herein). The present invention can also be implemented in any of a variety of ways, including by techniques, compositions and formulations known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,593,311 to Baric et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,156,558 to Johnston et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,650 to Johnston et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,342,372 to Dubensky et al.) modified in light of the teachings set forth herein. Applicants specifically intend that the disclosures of all United States patent references and patent publications cited herein be incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br/>The synthesis of large RNA transcripts (&#732;27 to 29 kb) in vitro is problematic, and the electroporation of such large RNA constructs, even in the presence of enhancing N transcripts, has also proven difficult, resulting in a 1% transfection efficiency. Therefore, transfecting cells with helper packaging constructs and subsequently passing the coronavirus VRPs in the presence of VEE-(E) VRPs can address this issue. In this way, VRPs can be amplified and high concentrations may amplify replicon titers for future applications. In addition, the use of a DNA launch platform, such as with a cytomegalovirus promoter, may be used to overcome any problems associated with an RNA launch system.<br/>The strategy presented herein for the assembly of SARS replicon constructs was based on a similar strategy for the construction of TGEV cDNA, employing six cDNA subclones that span the entire length of the SARS genome (see Yount et al. J. Virol. 74:10600-10611 (2000)). Each fragment is flanked by restriction sites that leave unique interconnecting junctions of 3 or 4 nt in length. These sticky ends are not complementary to most other sticky ends generated with the same enzyme at other sites in the DNA, allowing for the systematic assembly of SARS cDNAs by in vitro ligation.<br/>The infectious, replication defective, coronavirus particles can be prepared according to the methods disclosed herein in combination with techniques known to those skilled in the art. As one example, the method can comprise a) introducing into a coronavirus-permissive cell 1) a SARS coronavirus replicon RNA comprising a coronavirus packaging signal and a heterologous RNA, a first helper RNA encoding at least one coronavirus structural protein and a second (and possibly third, fourth, etc.) helper RNA encoding at least one coronavirus structural protein that is different from that encoded by the first helper RNA; b) producing the coronavirus particles in the cell; and c) optionally collecting the particles from the cell. The step of introducing the replicon RNA and helper RNA(s) into the coronavirus-permissive cell can be carried out according to any suitable means known to those skilled in the art. For example, uptake of the RNA into the cell can be achieved by any suitable means, such as for example, by treating the cells with DEAE-dextran, treating the cells with &#8220;LIPOFECTIN&#8482;,&#8221; and/or by electroporation, with electroporation being the currently preferred means. These techniques are well known in the art. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,440 to Davis et al., and PCT Publication No. WO 92/10578 to Bioption AB, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Alternatively, a DNA encoding the replicon RNA and/or a DNA encoding the helper RNA(s) can be introduced into the cell according to known methods and the DNA can be transcribed into RNA within the cell.<br/>The present invention also provides methods for producing SARS coronavirus replicon particles, as well as helper RNAs and helper cells employed in the production. Thus, in further embodiments, the present invention provides a helper cell for producing an infectious, multiplication-defective, coronavirus particle, comprising: (a) a SARS coronavirus replicon RNA comprising a SARS coronavirus packaging signal and a heterologous RNA sequence, wherein said replicon RNA further lacks a sequence encoding at least one coronavirus structural protein; and (b) at least one separate helper RNA encoding the at least one structural protein absent from the replicon RNA, said helper RNA lacking a coronavirus packaging signal; wherein the combined expression of the replicon RNA and the helper RNA produces an infectious, multiplication-defective coronavirus particle.<br/>As noted above, the replicon RNA can further comprise a sequence encoding at least one of the coronavirus structural proteins, provided that the replicon RNA does not comprise nucleic acid encoding all of the coronavirus structural proteins.<br/>In the helper cells of this invention, the helper RNA can comprise a nucleic acid sequence encoding a coronavirus structural protein that can be E, M, N, S, or any combination thereof, provided that the helper RNA does not comprise nucleic acid encoding all of the coronavirus structural proteins. The nucleic acid encoding the coronavirus structural protein can be from a coronavirus that can be SARS coronavirus, human respiratory coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, canine coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, rabbit coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus, sialodacryoadenitis virus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, bovine coronavirus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, turkey coronavirus and/or any other coronavirus now known or later identified, as well as combinations thereof, thereby resulting in chimeric coronavirus particles.<br/>Furthermore, the helper RNA can comprise nucleic acid of any other non-coronavirus, including, but not limited to, vaccinia virus, alphavirus, flavivirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, poxvirus, adenovirus, herpesvirus, paramyxovirus, parvovirus, papovavirus, adeno-associated virus, and retrovirus. The helper RNA can also be a vector of non-viral origin that provides nucleic acid encoding the coronavirus structural protein(s) not present on the replicon RNA in the helper cell.<br/>In certain embodiments, the replicon RNA and/or the helper RNA contains at least one attenuating gene order rearrangement among the 3A, 3B, HP, S, E, M and N genes. Helper or replicon RNAs (and their corresponding DNAs) that contain two or more genes optionally but preferably include a gene order rearrangement to attenuate (e.g., reduce the virulence) as compared to a corresponding wild-type virus that does not contain such a gene order rearrangement (i.e., comparing a virus with all of the necessary genes and the order rearrangement with a wild-type virus). Depending upon the number of genes within the helper or replicon RNA, it may contain two, three, or four or more gene order rearrangements. The wild-type gene order, from 5&#8242; to 3&#8242;, is: S, 3A, 3B, E, M, N, and HP. For example, modified orders for the replicon RNA, when the helper RNA(s) contains the E gene, may include: S, 3B, M, N, HP and 3A; 3A, 3B, M, N, HP and S; S, 3A, 3B, N, Hp, and M; etc. In other embodiments, the E gene may be provided alone on the replicon RNA, and the helper RNA(s) may contain the genes described above in the orders given above. Modified orders for the replicon RNA, when the helper RNA(s) contains the M and N (in natural or reverse order) genes, may include: 3A, 3B, E, S and HP; S, E, 3A, 3B, and HP; S, 3A, 3B, E, and HP; S, E, HP, 3A, and 3B, etc. In other embodiments, the replicon RNA may contain the M and N genes (in natural or reverse orders), and the remaining genes may be provided on the helper RNA(s) in orders such as given above. In still other embodiments, where the helper RNA(s) contains the S gene, the replicon RNA may contain the remaining genes in the order 3B 3A, E, M, N, and HP; 3A, 3B, E, N, M, and HP; 3B, 3A, E, N, M, and HP; etc. Again, the replicon RNA may contain the S gene, and the helper RNA(s) may contain the remaining genes in the orders given above. The 3A, 3B, and HP genes are nonessential and some or all may be deleted, or they may be included in an alternate order to serve as attenuating mutations. The genes may be divided among multiple helper RNAs, some or all of which contain gene order rearrangements. The foregoing examples are merely illustrative, and numerous additional variations will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.<br/>In other embodiments, an attenuating mutation can be introduced by deleting one or more of the nonessential genes 3A, 3B, and HP.<br/>In additional embodiments of the helper cells of this invention, the helper RNA(s) and/or the replicon RNA can comprise a promoter.<br/>Additionally provided herein as an embodiment of this invention is a DNA encoding a helper RNA of this invention and a helper cell comprising said helper RNA-encoding DNA, as well as a DNA encoding a replicon RNA of this invention and a helper cell comprising said replicon-encoding DNA. The DNA can be present in the cell transiently or in a stably transformed state. The DNAs of this invention can further comprise a promoter to direct the transcription of the helper RNA and the replicon RNA, respectively, in the helper cell.<br/>A further embodiment of this invention is a method of making infectious, multiplication-defective, coronavirus particles, comprising: a) providing the helper cells of this invention: and b) producing coronavirus particles in the helper cell. Optionally, the particles can be collected from the cells.<br/>In certain embodiments, the helper cell can be provided by introducing the replicon RNA and/or the helper RNA into the helper cell by electroporation. However, the replicon RNA and/or helper RNA, as well as their respective DNAs can be introduced into the helper cell according to any methods known in the art for introducing nucleic acid into a cell. The nucleic acids can be present in the helper cell transiently or as stable transformants.<br/>The present invention additionally provides infectious coronavirus particles produced by the methods of this invention.<br/>The step of producing the infectious viral particles in the helper cells can also be carried out using conventional techniques. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,440 to Davis et al., PCT Publication No. WO 92/10578 to Bioption AB, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,650,764 to Temin et al. (although Temin et al. relates to retroviruses rather than coronaviruses). The infectious viral particles may be produced by standard cell culture growth techniques.<br/>The step of collecting the infectious coronavirus particles can also be carried out using conventional techniques. For example, the infectious particles can be collected by cell lysis, or collection of the supernatant of the cell culture, as is known in the art. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,440 to Davis et al., PCT Publication No. WO 92/10578 to Bioption AB, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,650,764 to Temin et al. (although Temin et al. relates to retroviruses rather than coronaviruses). Other suitable techniques will be known to those skilled in the art. Optionally, the collected infectious coronavirus particles can be purified if desired. Suitable purification techniques are well known to those skilled in the art.<br/>In some embodiments, VEE replicon vectors can be used to express coronavirus structural genes in producing combination vaccines. Dendritic cells, which are professional antigen-presenting cells and potent inducers of T-cell responses to viral antigens, are preferred targets of VEE and VEE replicon particle infection, while SARS coronavirus targets the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. As the VEE and SARS replicon RNAs synergistically interact, two-vector vaccine systems are feasible that may result in increased immunogenicity when compared with either vector alone. Combination prime-boost vaccines (e.g., DNA immunization and vaccinia virus vectors) have dramatically enhanced the immune response (notably cellular responses) against target papillomavirus and lentivirus antigens compared to single-immunization regimens (Chen et al. (2000) Vaccine 18:2015-2022; Gonzalo et al. (1999) Vaccine 17:887-892; Hanke et al. (1998) Vaccine 16:439-445; Pancholi et al. (2000) J. Infect. Dis. 182:18-27). Using different recombinant viral vectors (influenza and vaccinia) to prime and boost may also synergistically enhance the immune response, sometimes by an order of magnitude or more (Gonzalo, et al. (1999) Vaccine 17:887-892). Thus, the present invention also provides methods of combining different recombinant viral vectors (e.g., VEE and SARS) in prime boost protocols.<br/>The examples, which follow, are set forth to illustrate the present invention, and are not to be construed as limiting thereof. In the following examples, mM means milli molar, &#956;g means microgram, &#956;l means milliliter, &#956;l means microliter, V means volt, &#956;F means microfarad, cm means centimeter, h means hour, ORF means open reading frame, GFP means green fluorescent protein, PBS means phosphate-buffered saline, M means molar, means second, nt means nucleotide, and min means minute.<br/>EXAMPLES<br/>Example 1<br/>Production of Full-Length Infectious cDNA of SARS Coronavirus<br/>Virus and Cells. The Urbani, Tor-2 and Tor-7 Canadian strains of SARS-CoV were propagated on VeroE6 cells in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and kanamycin (0.25 &#956;g/ml) and gentamycin (0.05 &#956;g/ml) at 37&#176; C. in a humidified CO2 incubator (Tor isolates were kindly provided by H. Feldmann). For virus growth, cultures of VeroE6 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 1 hr and samples were titered by plaque assay. At 1 hr postinfection, some cultures were treated with the cysteine protease inhibitor E64-d ({2S, 3S}-trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester) at a concentration of 500 &#956;g/ml. Virus plaques were visualized by neutral red staining at 2 days postinfection.<br/>Strategy for Cloning the SARS-CoV cDNAs. Reverse transcription was performed using Superscript II&#8482;, oligodeoxynucleotide primers and intracellular RNA from SARS infected cultures &#91;17, 18&#93;. The cDNA was denatured for 2 min at 94&#176; C. and amplified by PCR with Expand Long TAQ polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemical) for 25 cycles at 94&#176; C. for 30 sec, 58&#176; C. for 25-30 sec and 68&#176; C. for 1-7 min. The amplicons were cloned into Topo II TA (Invitrogen) (SARS subclones D-F) or in pSMART vectors (Lucigen) (SARS subclones A-C). All cDNAs were assembled as consensus sequences based on independent sequence analysis of 4-7 sibling clones and the reported Urbani sequence &#91;8&#93;. The following primers were used in the isolation of the SARS A subclone (forward: tactaatacgactcactatagatattaggtttttacctacccagg-1, SEQ ID NO:22; reverse: acaccatagtcaacgatgcc-4452, SEQ ID NO:23), SARS B subclone (forward: gcctatatgcatggatgttagat-4359, SEQ ID NO:24; reverse: tgaaccgccacgctggctaaacc-8727), SEQ ID NO:25, SARS C subclone (forward: agccagcgtggcggttcatac-8710, SEQ ID NO:26; reverse: aggcctcttgggcagtggcataag-12,085, SEQ ID NO:27), SARS D subclone (forward: actgcccaagatgcctatgagc-12,070, SEQ ID NO:28; reverse: cagccaggagggcagacttcacaacc-18,939, SEQ ID NO:29), SARS E subclone (forward: gtctgccctcctggctgataagtttccag-18,923, SEQ ID NO:30; reverse: gagcagccgtgtaggcagcaat-24066, SEQ ID NO:31) and SARS F subclone (forward: attgctgcctacacggctgctc-24,045, SEQ ID NO:32; reverse: (ttt)7gtcattctcctaagaagc-29,710, SEQ ID NO:33).<br/>To repair sibling clones, primer pairs were designed that contained a Class IIS restriction enzyme (e.g., AarI). Using high fidelity PCR, the consensus portions of different sibling clones were amplified, digested with AarI and ligated into plasmid. The AarI junctions were designed to seamlessly link consensus fragments, resulting in the production of a full-length cDNA &#91;17&#93;. Using an automated ABI DNA sequencer, 2-3 candidate DNAs were sequenced to identify the consensus clone.<br/>Systematic Assembly of a Full-Length SARS-CoV cDNA. The SARS A through F inserts were restricted, separated through 0.8% agarose gels, visualized with a Darkreader Lightbox (Claire Chemical), excised, and purified using the Qiaex II DNA purification kit. The SARS A+B, C+D and E+F subclones were ligated overnight and isolated &#91;17, 18&#93;. The SARS AB+CD+EF cDNAs were ligated overnight at 4&#176; C., phenol/chloroform extracted and precipitated under isopropyl alcohol. Full-length transcripts were generated in vitro as described by the manufacturer (Ambion, mMessage mMachine) with certain modifications &#91;17&#93;. For SARS N transcripts, 1 &#956;g of plasmid DNA encoding the N gene (primer: 5&#8242;-nnggcctcgatggccatttaggtgacactatagatgtctgataatggaccccaatc-3&#8242;; SEQ ID NO:34 and reverse primer 5-nnnttttttttttttttttttttttttttatgcctgagttcaatcagcag-3; SEQ ID NO:35) was transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase with a 2:1 ratio of cap analog to GTP.<br/>Transfection of Full-Length Transcripts. RNA transcripts were added to 800 &#956;l of the BHK cell suspension (8.0&#215;106) in an electroporation cuvette and three electrical pulses of 850 V at 25 &#956;F were given with a Gene Pulser II electroporator (BioRad) &#91;17, 18&#93;. The transfected BHK cells were seeded with 1.0-2.0&#215;106 uninfected Vero E6 cells in a 75 cm2 flask and incubated at 37&#176; C. for 2 days. Virus progeny were then passaged in Vero E6 cells at &#732;30 hr intervals and purified by plaque assay.<br/>Detection of Marker Mutations Inserted in icSARS-CoV. Intracellular RNA was isolated from either wild type or icSARS-CoV infected cells at 24 hrs postinfection. After RT-PCR, a 1668 nt amplicon (nt position 1007-2675) was obtained, spanning the Bgl1 site at position 1572 that had been ablated in the icSARS-CoV component clones, but not wild type SARS-CoV. Other PCR products included a 799 nt amplicon spanning the SARS-CoV B/C junction (nt position 8381-9180), a 544 nt amplicon (nt position 11,721-12,265) spanning the SARS-CoV C/D junction, a 652 nt amplicon spanning the SARS-CoV D/E junction, and a 1594 nt amplicon (nt position 23,665-25,259) spanning the SARS-CoV E/F junction. The 1594 nt SARS E/F junction-containing amplicon was subcloned and sequenced.<br/>RT-PCR of Leader-containing Transcripts. Leader containing amplicons were obtained from wild type and icSARS-CoV infected cells using primers at the 3&#8242; end of the genome (5&#8242;-tttttttttttttttttttttgtcattctcctaagaagc-3&#8242;; SEQ ID NO:36)) and in the SARS leader RNA sequence (5&#8242;-aaagccaaccaacctcgatc-3&#8242;; SEQ ID NO:37)). Leader-containing amplicons were excised from gels, subcloned into TopoII vectors and sequenced using appropriate primers.<br/>Assembly of Coronavirus Full Length cDNAs. Rapid response and control of exigent emerging pathogens requires an approach to rapidly generate full-length infectious cDNAs that afford genetic control over the genome. Full-length infectious cDNAs were isolated for TGEV, HCoV-229E, IBV and MHV strain A59 &#91;17-21&#93;. The approach described herein has been to isolate a panel of cDNAs spanning the entire coronavirus genome, which can be systematically and directionally assembled into a genome-length cDNA by in vitro ligation &#91;17, 18&#93;.<br/>Patterned after the strategy devised for TGEV &#91;18&#93;, the SARS genome was cloned by RT-PCR as six contiguous subclones linked by unique Bgl I restriction endonuclease sites. Bgl I is a class IIS restriction endonuclease that cleaves the symmetrical sequence GCCNNNN&#8595;NGGC (SEQ ID NO:38), but leaves 64 different asymmetrical ends. Consequently, pairs of contiguous subclones encoded junctions that allow unidirectional assembly of intermediates into a full-length cDNA. Two Bgl I junctions were derived from sites encoded within the SARS-CoV genome at positions nt 4373 (A/B junction) and nt 12,065 (C/D junction) &#91;8-10&#93;. A third Bgl I site at position nt 1557 was removed and new Bgl I sites were inserted by the introduction of silent mutations into the SARS-CoV sequence at positions nt 8700 (B/C junction), nt 18,916 (D/E junction) and at nt 24,040 (E/F junction). These mutations are shown in the Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NOs:10-14. SARS-CoV sequence toxicity was circumvented by disruption of toxic domains and the use of stable cloning vectors &#91;17&#93;. The resulting cDNAs include SARS A (nt 1-4436), SARS B (nt 4344-8712), SARS C (nt 8695-12,070), SARS D (nt 12,055-18,924), SARS E (nt 18,907-24,051) and SARS F (nt 24,030-29,736) subclones. The SARS A subclone contains a T7 promoter and the SARS F subclone terminates in 21 Ts, allowing for in vitro transcription of capped, polyadenylated transcripts.<br/>Numerous mutations were noted in each of the four to seven sibling subclones encoding a given SARS cDNA. To rapidly assemble a consensus clone, the &#8220;No See'm&#8221; approach was used with another group of class IIS restriction endonucleases that cut at asymmetric sites and leave asymmetric ends. These enzymes cut strand specific and allow the seamless ligation of cDNAs with the loss of the restriction site used to join two component clones &#91;17&#93;. As illustrated with the SARS F sibling clones, primer pairs were designed that contained terminal Aar I (CACCTGCNNN&#8595;NNNN, SEQ ID NO:39) sites that flanked each of the various consensus portions of different sibling clones. In some instances (amplicons 3 and 2 in sibling clones 1 and 4, respectively), primers were also designed to repair specific mutations located near the ends of a given amplicon. The combination of high fidelity PCR, oligonucleotide primer repair and the seamless ligation of sequence fragments &#91;17&#93;, rapidly generated Urbani consensus cDNAs for each of the SARS A, B, C, D, E and F subclones. Silent changes retained in the full length construct included an A to G change at nt position 6460, a T to C change at nt position 14,178, a T to C change at nt position 15,740, a C to T change at nt position 19,814, an A to G change at nt position 20,528 and a T to C change at nt position 20,555. These mutations are shown in the Sequence Listing as SEQ ID NOs:15-21.<br/>Rescue of Molecularly Cloned SARS-CoV. To build full length SARS-CoV cDNAs, individual subclones were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, ligated together in vitro and used as template for in vitro transcription with the T7 RNA polymerase. Since N transcripts enhance RNA transfection efficiencies of TGEV and MHV &#91;17,22&#93;, and are essential for IBV transcript infectivity &#91;20&#93;, SARS-CoV full-length transcripts were either electroporated into cells alone or mixed with SARS-CoV N transcripts. Within 48 hrs post transfection, SARS-CoV infected cells were detected by fluorescent antibody staining. Infectious virus (icSARS-CoV) titers approached 1.0&#215;106 PFU/ml at 48 hrs postinfection in the mixed transcript transfected cultures. Recombinant viruses were also detected in cultures transfected with genome-length SARS transcripts alone, but titers were reduced. As described with MHV &#91;17&#93;, SARS N transcripts may enhance infectivity of SARS full-length transcripts, but are not essential. The molecular cloned viruses were plaque purified in VeroE6 cells and produced similar sized plaques as wild type SARS Urbani.<br/>icSARS CoV Marker Mutations. Rescued icSARS-CoV, but not wild type SARS-CoV should contain several Bgl I sites that were engineered as junctions between the SARS B/C, D/E and E/F subclones and lack the Bgl I site at nt position 1557. Intracellular RNA was isolated from infected cultures, RT-PCR amplified using primer pairs flanking these various sites and subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with Bgl I. Clearly, icSARS-CoV contained the marker mutations inserted within and between the component clones. To confirm these findings, selected amplicons were cloned and sequenced, demonstrating that the icSARS-CoV originated from transcripts derived from the full-length cDNA construct.<br/>Phenotype of Rescued icSARS-CoV. Cultures of cells were infected with an MOI of 5. In untreated cultures, intracellular RNA and virus titers were determined as described herein. At 1 hr, cultures were treated with E64-d at a concentration of 500 &#956;g/ml and virus titers determined by plaque assay in VeroE6 cells.<br/>The recombinant icSARS CoV isolate replicated as efficiently as wild type Urbani, but less efficiently than the Canadian isolates, Tor-2 and Tor-7 SARS-CoV. These data demonstrate that the introduced alterations were not debilitating to virus growth in culture as both replicated to titers of about 107 within &#732;24-48 hrs postinfection. To further characterize the transcription strategy of SARS-CoV, intracellular RNA was isolated from Urbani wild type and icSARS-CoV-infected cultures. Following RT-PCR amplification of leader containing amplicons, sequence analysis indicated that wild type and icSARS-CoV subgenomic transcripts originated at identical CS sites, defined by the core sequence ACGAAC, as illustrated by leader-containing transcripts encoding X1, E, M, X3 and X4. SARS S and N encoding transcripts initiated subgenomic transcription at similar CS sites. This sequence represents a truncation of the AAACGAAC CS site that had been predicted by Rota et al., 2003 and is different from the group I, II and III coronavirus CS sequences, CUAAAC (TGEV), UCTAAAC (MHV), and CUUAACAA (IBV), respectively. Although previous studies had suggested that the SARS E protein and ORF X3 might be expressed from polycistronic mRNA, these findings indicate that independent transcripts are initiated at the core CS sequence ACGAAC noted at nt positions 26,109 for E transcripts and 26,913 for ORF X3 transcripts, respectively.<br/>In vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV Replication. Given the high virulence of SARS-CoV infection in humans, antiviral drugs will be required to reduce the scope and severity of disease. In MHV, the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64-d blocks replicase polyprotein processing and thereby inhibits viral RNA synthesis and virus growth &#91;11&#93;. To determine if icSARS-CoV was susceptible to the inhibitory effects of E64-d, growth analysis was performed in the presence and absence of 500 &#956;g/ml of drug. In the absence of E64-d, wild type and icSARS-CoV grew to equivalent titers of &#732;1.0&#215;107 PFU/ml after 24-48 hrs postinfection. Treatment of cells with a single dose of E64-d at 1 hr pi resulted in almost complete elimination of viral CPE and viral antigen expression and a significant &#732;3-4 log reduction in virus yield for both wild type SARS-CoV and icSARS-CoV at 24 and 48 hrs postinfection.<br/>Example 2<br/>Development of SARS Virus Single Hit Replicon Vector Vaccines<br/>SARS Replicon Particle Assembly. Viral replicon particles are single hit vectors that are incapable of spreading beyond the site of initial infection and are novel vaccine candidates for human and animal diseases. The SARS single hit replicon particles will be produced in the helper cells as described herein. Specifically, the SARS E, M, S and/or N structural proteins will be produced in helper cells from helper RNA or DNA, e.g., VEE VRPs, noncytotoxic Sindbis virus replicons, BAC or vaccinia vectors, CMV eukaryotic expression plasmids, etc., using standard protocols in order to provide SARS coronavirus structural proteins in trans for assembly of coronavirus replicon particles in helper cells. The SARS E, M, S and/or N coding sequences will be deleted from the replicon RNA and one or more heterologous coding sequences will be inserted into the replicon RNA. The replicon RNA will be packaged into coronavirus particles in the helper cells. Populations of the particles produced in the helper cells as described herein can be tested for the ability to maintain only a single round of infection by passage on coronavirus-permissive cells.<br/>Cell Preparation: VERO E6 Cells Expressing SARS E protein or M glycoprotein. Sindbis noncytotoxic replicon vectors (pSinRep) induce persistent infections in VERO and BHK cells, and constitutively express resistance to puromycin and a foreign gene of interest. these vectors have been used to constitutively express human CEA receptors in BHK cells, converting these cells to susceptible hosts for the MHV host range mutant V51. SARS E and M coding sequences will be inserted into pSinRep or CMV expression vectors, VERO E6 cells will be transfected and selected with puromycin (or G-418 for CMV vectors) for clones that stably express high concentrations of selected SARS structural proteins. The SARS E protein and M glycoprotein will also be expressed from VEE VRPs, and inoculated into mice for the production of monospecific antisera against each of these proteins. VEE VRPs have been used to produce high titer antiserum against Norovirus antigens, as well as the TGEV M and N proteins. Using flow cytometry and polyspecific antisera directed against the SARS E protein and M glycoprotein, enrichment for cells expressing high or low levels of the desired protein will be carried out. As VERO E6 cells are susceptible hosts for SARS replication, these cells will allow for additional rounds of infection with SARS VRPs with subsequent packaging and release of progeny VRPs.<br/>SARS Vector Replicon Design: First, a determination will be carried out regarding whether any of the group specific ORFs (X1-X5) can be deleted and replaced with either luciferase or GFP. Specifically, the focus will be on ORFs X1, X4 and X5 because of their position in the genome and the possibility that they encode luxury functions that are not essential for replication in vitro. The overall goal is to identify a group specific ORF that can be deleted and replaced with an indicator gene that allows for easy visualization of replication and gene expression. Such mutants will also be of value for drug screening. Essential points in these experiments are to leave the CS and surrounding flanking sequences intact, so that foreign gene expression is maximized. A second issue is that foreign genes may encode noncanonical CS sites that are transcriptionally active. To circumvent this problem, noncanonical &#8220;TAAACGAAC&#8221; CS sites in GFP or luciferase will be altered at the 3rd codon to prevent spurious expression of cryptic subgenomic RNAs. Growth curves will be performed to determine if rescued viruses replicate at equivalent levels with wild type SARS coronavirus and cultures will be examined for GFP or luciferase expression. The most viable of the ORFX1-X3 constructs will be used for future studies.<br/>SARS replicon genomes will be assembled by systematically deleting the E and/or M genes using the No See'm Strategy described in Yount et al. (2002). These constructs will be built within a backbone that encodes the luciferase gene as described above. In the case of M, the M ORF will be deleted and GFP or luciferase will be inserted, leaving the M CS site intact. In the latter two instances, this approach will allow for coordinated and equivalent levels of expression of upstream genes, while inserting a heterologous foreign nucleic acid for easy quantitation of VRP titers.<br/>SARS replicon constructs will be assembled as described, except that Not 1 sites will be encrypted at the 5&#8242; end of Clone A and 3&#8242; end of Clone F. Following assembly, the DNA will be restricted with Not 1 and inserted into BAC vectors. This allows for BAC propagation in bacteria and circumvents tedious reconstructions of SARS replicon constructs. The stability of these BAC vectors will be evaluated by serial passage and sequence analysis.<br/>Stable VRP Single Hit Expression Vectors. Successful development of stable single hit SARS replicon vectors will be demonstrated by standard approaches. To titer VRP stocks, quantitative methods have been developed that rely on serial dilution and counting cells expressing nucleic acid encoding GFP or viral and heterologous antigens by fluorescent antibody staining in a number of randomly chosen but defined (&#956;m2) fields. Titers are estimated by counting the number of fluorescent cells in a known area, statistically determining the mean and then adjusting for total area of the plate. Alternatively, viral VRP stocks can be quantified by endpoint PCR or quantitative PCR, potentially compromised by an unknown particle/PFU ratio. It is expected that the SARS M glycoprotein and E protein will be essential for assembly and release, based upon experience with TGEV. However, it has been suggested that SARS is more closely akin to the group II coronaviruses like MHV, so it is also possible that SARS E protein may be nonessential for packaging and release.<br/>A number of VRP phenotypes will be analyzed. The SARS VRPs lacking E protein should be single hit vectors in VERO E6 cells, but should serially passage in VERO E6 cells expressing E in trans. Similarly, SARS VRPs lacking M glycoprotein should be packaged and released from VERO E6 cells expressing M, but not E. SARS VRP protein expression will be determined by Western Blot assays, to determine if E or M excision alters expression levels of other SARS structural and nonstructural ORFs as compared with wild type. This will be accomplished with antiserum generated from the VEE VRPs inoculated into mice. GFP or luciferase expression will be measured by fluorescence and Western Blot assays, using commercially available antibodies and screens. The ability of different packaging cell lines (e.g., alphavirus vectored, CMV vectored) to support the production of high titered SARS VRPs will be compared. RNA recombination is always a concern with a vectored packaging cell lines, so progeny VRPs will be isolated and passaged several fold in a packaging cell line and passaged onto control cells lacking the appropriate structural protein in trans.<br/>SARS-CoV Recombinant Protein Assays. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) is a member of the alphavirus genus of the family Togaviridae. The virus consists of an icosahedral nucleocapsid composed of 240 copies of the capsid protein (C) surrounded by an envelope containing spikes formed from two glycoproteins, E1 and E2. The VEE genome is a positive sense single stranded RNA of 11.5 kb, which replicates through a minus strand intermediate. A subgenomic 26S mRNA, transcribed from the 26S promoter resident internally on the minus strand, encodes the structural proteins and is synthesized at &#732;10&#215; molar excess relative to genome. Four nonstructural replicase proteins (nsp1-4) mediate all transcription steps, which occur in the cell cytoplasm, and virus budding is at the plasma membrane.<br/>The VEE genome, when introduced into a cell, can be viewed as a highly efficient machine for the production of large amounts of its own structural proteins through the transcription of a subgenomic mRNA encoding these proteins. If a nucleic acid of interest is substituted for the structural protein genes, then the VEE replicative machine expresses high levels of that gene product. In the VEE replicon vaccine vectors, an immunizing gene is substituted for the structural protein genes. Upon electroporation of replicon RNA into cells, the VEE replication machinery produces high levels of the subgenomic mRNA and vectored gene product. However, as the structural protein genes are not present in the replicon RNA, no new virus particles are released. One can package the replicon into &#8220;replicon particles&#8221; by supplying the structural proteins in trans from helper RNAs. The replicase proteins encoded on the replicon RNA provide the machinery for replicating the helper RNAs, while the structural proteins encoded by the helpers encapsidate and envelope the replicon RNA. Only the replicon RNA is packaged into VEE replicon particles (VRP), because only the replicon RNA contains the cis-acting packaging signal. When VRPs infect another cell, either in culture or in vivo, the replicon RNA synthesizes high levels of the gene product, but no new replicon particles are formed due the absence of the structural protein genes. Therefore, these vectors are not cell to cell transmitted.<br/>Alphavirus Vectored Expression of Recombinant SARS-CoV Proteins. The SARS S, E, N, M, and the group specific ORFs were cloned into VEE and packaged into VRPs. Following infection with VRP-S and VRP-N, cultures were radiolabeled with 35S-Met from 12-16 hrs post infection, resulting in the expression of a SARS 46 kDa N protein and a &#732;177/205 kDa S glycoprotein. VRP-E and VRP-M also expressed appropriately sized products using these conditions. Various VRP-group specific ORFs have also been inoculated into mice and cells. These data suggest 1) VRP immunization induced significant antibodies to authentic S protein expressed from three different SARS isolates or with the rescued molecularly cloned icSARS-CoV (Similar results have been obtained with VRP-E, VRP-M and VRP-N antiserum), 2) patient serum was reactive with the S protein expressed by the VRPs and by icSARS-CoV, and 3) SARS ORF3a is immunogenic and detected by convalescent patient serum. The SARS-S gene, designed to produce either membrane-bound or secreted forms, is also available and antiserum against the group specific ORFs is being raised in mice. SARS-CoV PRNT90 titers were &#732;1:905 with VRP-S vs. <1:80 with VRP-HA (flu HA).<br/>VEE replicon particles (VRPs) expressing the SARS S protein have been constructed and antigen derived from cells infected with these vectors was initially evaluated as a target for EIA assays. Vero cells were infected with VRP-SARS(S) at a MOI of 6.0 for 15 hours and the cells were lysed with 0.5% NP-40. The optimal antigen concentration was found to be a 1:300 dilution. Using this assay, the human convalescent serum was shown to have an endpoint (the last dilution with an O.D. reading&#8807;0.200) anti-SARS virus IgG titer of 1:3200, while serum from two uninfected control individuals had titers of <1:200. Sera from mice that received a primary inoculation of VRP-SARS(S) in the rear footpads, followed by a boost at week 5 post primary inoculation, were evaluated at two weeks post boost and ranged from 1:1600 to 1:6400 (ave.=3300, n=12), while control animals that received VRP expressing the influenza virus A/PR/8 HA gene had titers of 1:100-1:200 (ave=150, n=2). Similar assays were developed for other SARS structural protein, providing a unique panel of reagents to measure immune responses following SARS-CoV infection in rodents.<br/>To perform CTL assays and other immunologic experiments, the SARS S and N proteins were inserted into vaccinia virus vectors.<br/>Example 3<br/>Deletion of SARS Virus Group Specific ORFs<br/>The SARS virus genome encodes several group specific ORFs at the 3&#8242; end of the genome including ORFs 3a/b (X1, X2), 6 (X3), 7a/b (X4), 8a/b (X5) and 9b. By analogy with other coronaviruses, it is believed that one or more of these group specific ORFs encode luxury functions that do not specifically contribute to virus replication in vitro but disable virus pathogenesis in vivo. This invention includes the systematic and combined deletion or knocking out of expression of these various ORFs and rescue of the molecularly cloned viruses containing these genetic lesions. All recombinant viruses are obtained following transfection in Vero cells similar to those certified for cultivation and production of human virus vaccines.<br/>Protocols are carried out wherein the group specific nucleic acid sequences designated ORFs 3a/b, 6, 7a/b, 8 and 9a are deleted. Initially, each of the ORFs is systematically deleted, either by deletion of individual ORFs (ORF3a-X1, ORF6-X3, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8a, ORF8b), entire TRS cistrons (e.g., ORF3a/b; ORF7a/b-X4; ORF8a/b-X5), or by mutations that specifically ablate ATG start codons and introduce premature stop codons in an overlapping gene (ORF3b-X2, ORF9b). For deletions, a particular gene and its corresponding CS site (when appropriate) is excised, and the flanking upstream and downstream ORFs seamlessly stitched together. For example, two amplicons are isolated using primer pairs that are designed to contain external Bsa1 sites that are lost but leave complementary four nucleotide asymmetric sites that direct seamless ligation of the SARS CoV ORF 6 and ORF 8 CS sites, simultaneously deleting the entire ORF 7a/b sequence. The ATG start is knocked out and a premature stop is inserted into ORF3a (X1) and ORF6 (X3) because virus phenotypes are not confounded by changes in transcription.<br/>SARS-CoV from civet cats and human patients early in the epidemic contained a 29 bp insertion in ORF8a/b that resulted in a single ORF 8 protein. As it has been suggested that this deletion may have enhanced SARS-CoV pathogenicity in humans and perhaps transmission, the Civet cat full length ORF8 by fusing ORF8a and 8b will be reconstructed by insertion of the 29 bp sequence identified in this virus, with the expectation that the addition of a full-length civet cat ORF8 will attenuate pathogenesis.<br/>In mRNA3 transcripts encoding ORF 3a, ORF 3b is encoded as an overlapping out of frame 124 amino acid ORF that cannot be deleted without removing a significant portion of ORF 3a. If both ORFs encode luxury functions in vitro, recombinant viruses lacking each ORF will be rescued separately. While deletion of ORF 3a is straightforward, ORF 3b also contains ten in frame ATG start codons, thus selective mutagenesis of ORF3b start codons will only N-terminally truncate ORF X3b (if internal ATGs translate efficiently). Consequently, premature ORF3b stop codons will be introduced into the sequence: &#8220;25735CAGTGTCACAGAT&#8221; (SEQ ID NO:40) to &#8220;CAGTGTGACAGAT&#8221; (SEQ ID NO:41). This alteration introduces a stop codon that truncates ORF3b after 24 amino acids, but doesn't change the protein sequence of ORF3a. A global approach is to combine this termination codon with additional mutations that destroy the ORF3b ATG start codon at residues 1 and 2, but leave the ORF 3a amino acid sequence intact. Changes will be introduced into the SARS CoV F subclone, which will be re-sequenced and then reassembled into full-length cDNAs. A similar strategy will be used to knockout ORF9b in mRNA9, which also encodes the N protein (ORF9a). Following in vitro transcription, full-length transcripts will be mixed with N transcripts (to enhance infectivity), introduced into cells by electroporation. Rescued viruses will be quantified by plaque assay.<br/>Deletion of SARS-CoV Group Specific Genes. The SARS-CoV ORF3a (X1), ORF 6 (X3) and ORF 7a/b (X4) domains have been deleted and recombinant viruses have been isolated that replicated in Vero cells. Moreover, ORF7a/b has been replaced with luciferase under control of the 7a/b TRS and is expressed in icSARS-CoV&#916;X4 infected cells. Following transfection, leader containing transcripts were identified, and ORF3a/ORF6/ORF 7a/b deletions were confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. Passage of progeny virions revealed abundant viral protein expression in icSARS-CoV, icSARS-CoV &#916;X3 and &#916;X4-infected cultures, although protein expression in icSARS-CoV &#916;X1 infected cultures was less robust. At this time it is not possible to determine if this reflected a lower initial transfection efficiency or lower rates of virus replication. The SARS-CoV X1 and X3 ORFs encode interferon antagonist genes. It seems likely that virus growth might be boosted in certain cell types by providing IFN antagonist genes in trans, should the &#916;X1 molecularly cloned variant be highly attenuated in replication. Based on findings with other highly pathogenic viruses, the deletion of IFN antagonists should attenuate virus replication and pathogenesis in vitro. More importantly, the data demonstrate the feasibility of using 1) the SARS-CoV cDNA reverse genetics to modify the SARS-CoV genome, 2) that several group specific genes of SARS-CoV encode luxury functions for in vitro growth (ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6 and ORF7a and ORF7b) and 3) it can be determined if deletion of SARS-CoV IFN antagonist genes and group specific genes attenuate pathogenesis in vivo in the mouse, ferret and eventually primate model for SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Deletion of ORF3a/b (X1 and X2 protein) also results in the rescue of viable progeny viruses, supporting the notion that deletion of multiple accessory (group specific) ORFs still allow for the recovery of robust viruses. All deletion mutants tested replicate to titers in excess of 107 PFU/ml in 32 hrs. We have also produced a SARS-CoV isolate expressing GFP from the ORF7a/b location. Recombinant viruses encoding either the Luciferase or GFP indicator molecules provide a rapid screen for identifying compounds that block SARS-CoV replication and gene expression. Reduced expression of either luciferase or GFP in the presence of drug allows for rapid identification of compounds with antiviral activity.<br/>SARS-CoV Minimal Genome Recombinants/Multiple Accessory Gene Knockouts. In addition to deleting each of the group specific ORFs, the nonessential ORFs can be deleted in combination. The goal is to produce a minimal SARS genome lacking as many of the group specific ORFs as possible (SARS &#916;3a/b,6,7a/b,8a/b), while retaining adequate levels of virus replication in vitro. In the case of MHV, deletion of group specific ORFs significantly attenuated MHV pathogenesis in mice and recombinants lacking combinations of group specific genes were generally more attenuated than isolates lacking a single group specific ORF, but not always. No experiments were conducted to determine if mutant-infected animals were protected against wild type challenge.<br/>All TGEV and MHV group specific ORFs were nonessential for in vitro replication and at least ORF3a (X1), ORF3a/3b (X1/X2), ORF6 (X3) and ORF7a/b (X4) are nonessential for SARS-CoV replication. Thus, most, if not all, of the SARS virus group specific ORFs are believed to be capable of being deleted, resulting in a minimal genome that should be attenuated in vivo. Following mutagenesis of the SARS F subclone, assembly of the cDNAs and electroporation of transcripts, recombinants will be rescued from transfected cultures.<br/>Other attenuating mutations. Mutations can be inserted virtually anywhere in the SARS-CoV genome including the replicase, the replicase ribosome frame shifting site, 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; transcriptional regulatory sequences, and alterations in the SARS-CoV structural genes as examples.<br/>Characterization of Rescued Viruses. Rescued viruses will be harvested between 24 to 36 hrs post transfection and plaque purified prior to isolating low passage stocks in Vero E6 cells. During production of the recombinant virus stocks, passage numbers will be kept to a minimum so that potential 2nd site compensatory changes that restore virus replication and fitness do not have time to evolve and severely complicate an accurate interpretation of the effects of particular changes on SARS replication fitness.<br/>Genotype Analysis. Plaque purified molecularly cloned viruses will be inoculated into Vero E6 cells and intracellular RNA isolated using Trizol reagents. Using RT-PCR and primer-pairs that flank the various group specific ORFs, the presence or absence of group specific ORFs will be determined in recombinant viruses by size analysis of PCR product and by sequence analysis of amplicons. The S gene through the 3&#8242; end of the genome will also be cloned and sequenced to identify potential 2nd site alterations that may have evolved in response to group specific gene deletion. As the gene order has been restructured by deleting various group specific ORFs, it is possible that these rearrangements may restructure TRS networks and the function of individual CS sites involved in the synthesis of a particular subgenomic transcript (most likely a gene upstream or downstream of the deleted ORF). To determine if subgenomic RNA synthesis originated from the appropriate CS sites, leader containing amplicons that flank the various group specific ORF deletions will be RT-PCR cloned and sequenced.<br/>Phenotype Analysis. There are no precise in vitro correlates to in vivo SARS pathogenesis, so a variety of phenotypic characteristics will be measured to provide a global view of rescued-virus fitness in cell culture. Virus growth will be evaluated in culture, as well as plaque morphology. Rescued molecularly cloned viruses will be analyzed for SARS protein expression by immunoprecipitation or Western blots using antiserum from mice inoculated with alphavirus VRPs encoding the various SARS virus structural and group specific ORFs. By immunoblot, the expression of the structural and various group specific nonstructural proteins that are produced following gene deletion will be measured. Northern Blot analysis will be used to identify the viral mRNAs and determine if selected gene deletion(s) alter the molar ratio of the upstream and downstream viral mRNAs. In selected instances, cultures will be radiolabeled with 3H-uridine and the labeling kinetics of viral mRNAs and replicative forms RNAs analyzed. These experiments will also determine 1) deletion effects on RNA expression patterns, and 2) deletion effects on relative molar ratios of mRNA. These experiments will also determine if full length and subgenomic length replicative form RNAs are present in SARS virus infected cells, as shown with other group I and II coronaviruses.<br/>Stability of Rescued Virus with Passage: Compensatory Evolution. TGEV deletion and gene rearranged viruses have been shown to rapidly evolve 2nd site compensatory changes that restore virus growth fitness in vitro. It is believed that the 2nd site changes will subtly alter coronavirus gene networks and protein-protein interactions to restore virus growth in vitro, yet enhance attenuation in animal models by subtly changing the affinity of these highly orchestrated interactions that influence replication in the human host. To test this hypothesis, the most debilitated rescued viruses that have deletions in one or more group specific ORFs will be tested. Recombinant viruses will be inoculated onto Vero E6 cells and progeny viruses passaged into fresh cultures at 24 hrs intervals. After 15-20 passages, progeny virus will be plaque purified and compared to wild type virus by growth curves and gene expression patterns. The corresponding SARS E and F genome fragments will be cloned and sequenced. Consensus SARS E and F subclones will be assembled into the full length cDNA to identify the exact 2nd site mutations that restore replication fitness. In the case of multiple alterations, the mutation that confers the strongest fitness recovery phenotype will be tracked. Although replicase mutations may also restore growth, preliminary data suggests that most of the compensatory changes will cluster at the 3&#8242; end of the genome.<br/>Rewiring the Coronavirus Genome. Mutation in the SARS Transcription Regulatory Sequence Attenuates Replication and Recombination. Live virus vaccine development provides an approach for identifying virulence alleles and pathogenic determinants, providing a template our understanding viral pathogenesis. Live viruses that lack several of the SARS-CoV group specific ORFs have been rescued, and are being tested for whether such viruses are attenuated.<br/>The coronavirus TRS includes the highly conserved CS and flanking sequences, which regulate the efficiency of coronavirus transcription. It is believed that 1) mutations in the leader and body CS will attenuate SARS-CoV gene expression, and 2) SARS-CoV CS regulatory networks can be rewired, making these rescued viruses highly resistant to RNA recombination repair at the 3&#8242; end of the genome. The goal is to develop viruses that have significantly different TRS regulatory networks that upon recombination create incompatibility networks that disrupt expression of subgenomic mRNAs. These &#8220;rewired&#8221; SARS-CoV will be highly resistant to recombination repair from wild type viruses and other coronaviruses. These experiments will enhance the feasibility of safe SARS-CoV attenuated seed stocks for killed vaccines and serve as a model for engineering recombination resistant viruses.<br/>Leader/body CS Compensatory Mutations. Previous studies with arteriviruses and TGEV indicated that mutations in the leader CS globally suppress transcription of all subgenomic mRNAs, unless the corresponding mutations are also duplicated into the body CS. Rewiring the Nidovirus transcription regulatory network provides a novel approach to selectively attenuate gene expression of certain genes while maintaining efficient expression of other genes. The current hypothesis is that the actual CS sequence is not so critical, the major factor being that CS sites must allow for communication via efficient base-pairing for discontinuous transcription of subgenomic RNAs. It is believed that double and triple compensatory mutations in the leader/body CS will allow for viable viruses with robust gene expression, but be highly resistant to recombination repair.<br/>Selected mutations (CS mutations 1 and 2) will be inserted into the 5&#8242; leader CS and body CS of the N structural gene (Tables 1 and 2), in essence producing SARS-CoV single hit replicon RNAs as described herein. N CS sites are targeted initially, as N subgenomic transcripts are closest to the 3&#8242; end of the genome and expressed most abundantly, providing a reliable signal for detection. N transcript expression from single hit TGEV replicons has been detected under similar conditions. The CS mutational spectra were chosen as: 1) the sequence is unique in the SARS-CoV genome and 2) it differs from CS sites present in other group I-III coronaviruses. Cultures will be transfected with recombinant virus RNA genomes and subgenomic transcription will be measured by quantitative RT-PCR using primers in the leader sequence and the body sequence of several structural genes, including N and genomic RNA. It is expected that robust N transcript expression will be demonstrated, with little if any expression of other subgenomic mRNAs. It may prove necessary to test other potential leader/body CS sequences that effectively optimize subgenomic expression of N, but not the other SARS-CoV transcripts. This will be tested empirically should the initial mutations prove unsatisfactory for driving mRNA expression (as determined by the relative ratio of genome to mRNA expression).<br/>Using the most robust CS sites identified in the initial experiment, the remainder of the SARS-CoV CS sites will be converted to the new consensus sequence. Recombinant viruses (csSARS-CoV) will be assembled and transcripts electroporated into cells. Such viruses will be viable in culture and should express normal ratios of mRNA, RF RNA and protein.<br/>At 24-36 hrs post transfection, rescued viruses will be plaque purified and stocks grown in Vero E6 cells as previously described. Virus passage will be minimized to prevent the emergence of 2nd site compensatory changes that restore virus growth fitness in culture. If recombinant viruses grow inefficiently, virus will be passaged 15-20&#215; and mutants with increased growth kinetics and gene expression patterns will be identified by comparison with wild type (e.g., growth curves, structural protein expression, and northern blots). Given that reversion to wild type sequence in the leader/body CS sites is unlikely because of the requirement for multiple mutations (&#732;18-27 changes in total genome CS sites), revertants will likely contain compensatory changes that reside in replicase proteins that interact with SARS-CoV TRS sites or in the flanking TRS sites that regulate discontinuous transcription (less likely as several would be required). These will be identified by sequence analysis followed by reintroduction of specific mutations into the full length cDNA construct.<br/>Genotype Analysis. Plaque purified molecularly cloned viruses will be inoculated onto Vero E6 cells and intracellular RNA isolated using Trizol reagents. Using RT-PCR and primer-pairs that flank selected leader and body TRS mutations, amplicons will be sequenced to confirm that rescued viruses contain the expected alterations. Using RT-PCR, leader-containing amplicons representing each of the downstream transcripts that are synthesized during infection will also be cloned and sequenced. However, it is possible that altered CS mutants might initiate subgenomic transcripts from noncanonical sites. Any such aberrant leader-containing amplicons will be identified by sequencing. Depending upon the level of expression, the aberrant CS sequence in newly emerged TRS sites will be mutated to knock out indiscriminant subgenomic transcription.<br/>Phenotype Analysis. Virus growth will be evaluated in culture and by plaque morphology. Rescued molecularly cloned viruses will be analyzed for SARS protein expression by Western Blot using antiserum from mice inoculated with alphavirus replicon particles encoding the various SARS structural and selected group specific ORFs. The ratios of structural proteins that are expressed in the rescued viruses will be determined by Western blot. Northern blot analysis will be used to identify the viral mRNAs and determine if selected TRS mutations alter the molar ratio of the upstream and downstream subgenomic viral mRNAs or the emergence of additional transcripts originating from newly recognized body CS sites. In selected instances, cultures will be radiolabeled with 3H-uridine and the labeling kinetics of viral mRNAs and replicative form RNAs will be analyzed.<br/>New CS sites will be demonstrated to be stable in the SARS-CoV genome and allow for efficient gene expression and virus growth. The stability of selected mutants will be determined by serial passage in Vero E6 cells with particular focus on: 1) stability of leader/body CS sites and the evolution of group specific gene expression, and 2) mechanisms of fitness recovery. Putative compensatory mutations that restore virus replication fitness will be reintroduced into the full-length construct to prove causality between particular alterations, growth recovery and enhanced gene expression.<br/>RNA Recombination with wild type SARS-CoV. Several approaches will be used to test whether &#8220;re-networked&#8221; SARS-CoV can recombine efficiently with wild type SARS-CoV. In one approach, select wild type CS sites will be introduced back into the SARS-CoV re-networked genome. For example, the M CS site will be altered back to &#8220;ACGAAC&#8221; and a determination will be made regarding whether viable recombinant viruses can be isolated. As the M glycoprotein is essential for growth, this is a strong selective screen for viability. It is anticipated that such viruses will grow poorly and require passage for selection of compensatory changes that reestablish growth. Such changes would likely evolve within the CS site, given only 1 or 2 mutations might be required to restore functionality of the body CS. In a second approach, a theoretical single crossover recombinant virus that contains the &#8220;mutated&#8221; leader CS will be coupled with all 3&#8242; end CS sites derived from the wild type virus. Reflecting what would happen if a recombination event occurred in the replicase of a &#8220;re-networked&#8221; virus and wild type virus, it will be determined if the engineered leader CS site will communicate and drive subgenomic transcripts from a wild type 3 end genome. It is anticipated that such viruses would be heavily impaired and that subgenomic transcription might occur from noncanonical sites. Subgenomic transcription will be measured by quantitative RT-PCR using primer sets in the leader sequence and in various structural genes. Transfected cultures and supernatants will be passaged (15-20&#215;) to allow for the emergence of revertants that will be analyzed as described herein. Reversion, if it occurs, would likely occur through the emergence of one or more mutations in the leader CS. In a third approach, as in the second approach, a similar experiment will be performed, but in this instance, the 3&#8242; end of the re-networked SARS-CoV genome will be replaced with the 3&#8242; end of MHV (S through N). In one construct, the 3&#8242;-most &#732;500 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV genome that might contain cis-acting sequences needed for replication will be maintained and in a second construct, the entire SARS-CoV N gene and CS site will be included. In essence, a potential double recombinant genome will be generated that might occur between another group II coronavirus and SARS-CoV. Such viruses are not anticipated to be viable because of communication problems between the SARS-CoV replicase and the leader/body CS sites and potential encapsidation sequence problems associated with an MHV N protein (construct 1). In the second construct, the N protein will be derived from SARS-CoV but it must communicate with the MHV M, E and S proteins to mediate assembly of infectious virus, which is not likely.<br/>Other rewiring approaches to prevent recombination repair of live attenuated viruses: Other approaches to produce recombination resistant viruses include: 1) repositioning the SARS-CoV encapsidation sequence to different locations in the genome, 2) rewiring the replicase protein cleavage sites to a different recognition sequence, 3) reorganizing the SARS-CoV gene order and 4) any other methods that establish genome incompatibilities following recombination with any other circulating human strain.<br/>Example 4<br/>SARS Virus Gene Order Rearrangement<br/>Because N gene rearrangements are well tolerated in the group I and II coronavirus genomes, in initial studies, the N gene position will be moved to new sites immediately downstream (SARS SNEM) and upstream of S (SARS NSEM). Second generation constructs will include rearrangement of ORF7 or 8, the N gene upstream of S (SARS 7/8NSEM6) and an E protein/M glycoprotein reposition upstream of S as well (SARS EMSN). The SARS S glycoprotein will also be repositioned to the 3&#8242; proximal location (SARS EMNS). The putative IFN antagonist genes encoded in ORF3a and ORF6 will also be repositioned, potentially altering levels of gene expression and activity. Depending upon the outcome of these experiments, more radical rearrangements may be performed in which multiple genes are repositioned to multiple sites. Care will be taken to maintain tight genetic juxtaposition and the appropriate TRS control such that rearranged genes will use their normal CS site for expression of subgenomic mRNAs. After introducing these rearrangements into the SARS F subclone, sequence analysis will be used to identify the consensus cDNA used in the assembly of full length SARS cDNAs. Molecularly cloned viruses will be rescued as described. Any number of rearranged SARS-CoV genomes can be built using the molecular clone or any other method to alter the 3&#8242; end of the SARS-CoV genome. Gene order rearranged viruses should be significantly resistant to recombination repair.<br/>Phenotype and Genotype Analysis of Rescued Viruses. Rescued viruses will be isolated between 24-36 hrs post transfection, plaque purified and stocks grown in Vero E6 cells as previously described. Virus passage will be minimized to prevent the emergence of mutations that restore growth fitness in culture.<br/>Genotype Analysis. Plaque purified molecularly cloned viruses will be inoculated into Vero E6 cells and intracellular RNA isolated using Trizol reagents. Using RT-PCR and primer-pairs that flank the newly rearranged genes, the presence of the mutant gene order in rescued viruses will be demonstrated. The amplicons will be sequenced to confirm the expected gene rearrangements. As rearrangements may alter expression of flanking genes, leader-containing amplicons will be RT-PCR cloned and sequenced to determine if subgenomic RNA synthesis has originated from appropriate CS sites.<br/>Phenotype Analysis. Virus growth will be evaluated in culture and by plaque morphology. Rescued molecularly cloned viruses will be analyzed for SARS protein production by Western Blot using antiserum from mice inoculated with VRPs encoding the various SARS virus structural proteins and group specific ORFs. By Western Blot or immunoprecipitation with 35S-methionine labeled cell extracts, the expression of the structural and various group specific nonstructural proteins that are expressed following gene rearrangement will be measured. Northern Blot analysis will be used to identify the viral mRNAs and determine if selected gene rearrangements alter the molar ratio of the upstream and downstream viral mRNAs. In selected instances, cultures will be radiolabeled with 3H-Uridine and the kinetics of viral mRNA and replicative forms (RF) RNA synthesis will be analyzed. These experiments will allow for the determination of 1) whether full length and subgenomic length RF RNAs are present in SARS-CoV infected cells, 2) effects of reorganization on RNA expression, and 3) reorganization effects on relative molar ratios of mRNA and RF RNA.<br/>Stability and Recombination Repair. Compensatory Evolution. Recombinants will be inoculated into Vero E6 cells and progeny viruses passaged into fresh cultures at 24 hrs postinfection. After 15-20 passages, growth curves and plaque size will be compared to wild type virus. Then, consensus SARS E and F subclones that contain mutations of interest will be reintroduced back into the full length cDNA to identify 2nd site mutations that restore replication fitness in the rearranged viruses.<br/>RNA Recombination Repair: Gene order rearranged viruses are expected to be highly stable and several fold more resistant to RNA recombination repair by wild type viruses. Using SARS NSEM and SARS wild type as an example, it is noted that most recombination events originating from SARS NSEM to SARS wild type will result in an N gene deletion, a lethal event which reduces the recombination frequency by one-half. In contrast, recombination events originating from SARS wild type to SARS NSEM will predominantly lead to recombinant genomes containing two copies of N, which at least in the case of TGEV reduces replication fitness by about 1 log of titer. Only recombination events occurring within the pol genes of both viruses will reconstruct wild type virus, hardly a significant problem as it would only add to the wild type virus burden already present. Consequently, it is expected that gene order rearrangements will attenuate RNA recombination repair to give wild type genomes. In the absence of wild type virus, it is highly unlikely that RNA recombination can restore the gene order of SARS NSEM. This is because several recombination events are necessary, including duplication of the N gene at the 3&#8242; end of the genome (a double recombination event), followed by deletion of N from the upstream position.<br/>To test this hypothesis, two approaches will be used. In the first approach, cultures of cells will be coinfected with selected gene order rearranged viruses (SARS SNEM) and SARS wild type virus containing a deletion in the S CS and N-terminal S protein sequence and a GFP indicator. This genome should replicate but result in noninfectious virus particles lacking S. Rescue of the genome can occur by recombination or by phenotypic mixing of S glycoprotein provided by SARS SNEM in trans. The basic approach is to transfect with SARS &#916;S and then infect with SARS SNEM at a MOI of 2 and passage progeny 3&#215; (at high MOI<SARS &#916;S should passage if S provided in trans). Using quantitative RT-PCR and primer pairs spanning the N/adjacent gene (SARS SNEM would be N/ORF3a; SARS wild type would be ORF8/N), virions will be harvested from supernatants at each passage, concentrated through gradients, and titered by plaque assay and quantitative RT-PCR using primer sets that detect SARS SNEM, SARS wild type and SARS SNEMN recombinant viruses. Green plaques (3&#215;) can also be plaque-purified and the genotype of recombinant viruses characterized. In the second approach, a SARS 2N virus (the progeny of a wild type x SNEM recombination event) is constructed, which is expected to be replication impaired as compared to wild type.<br/>Example 5<br/>Remodeling SARS-CoV Genome Regulatory Networks Obstructs RNA Recombination<br/>Live virus vaccines are a crucial intervention strategy documented to improve the overall health of communities because they have induced long-term immune responses that protect against a variety of highly pathogenic human and animal pathogens over the past century. Concerns regarding reversion to virulence by mutation and recombination, coupled with the associated challenges in commercially developing these vaccines, have diminished the appeal of using live virus vaccines in human and animal populations. The dichotomy between the well known protective efficacy and costs and risks of developing live virus vaccines has been recognized as one of the grand challenges in global health by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, calling for the development of new methods to stabilize and prevent reversion or recombination repair of attenuating alleles in live virus vaccines.<br/>SARS-CoV was recognized as a highly pathogenic respiratory human pathogen that emerged suddenly and subsequently spread worldwide during the first few months of 2003. By the end of the outbreak, over 8,000 people had been infected, resulting in some 800 deaths worldwide. Demonstration of zoonotic forms of the SARS-CoV, both in farm animals and in bat populations, dictate a need for continued surveillance and the development of efficacious vaccines and therapeutics targeted to prevent reemergence and spread of this important human pathogen. SARS-CoV is an excellent model system for coronavirus vaccine development as this pathogen replicates efficiently in a variety of animal models, it is highly pathogenic in its normal host, the genome is well characterized, a reverse genetic system exists to manipulate the genome (49), and other important coronaviruses have been identified that cause significant diseases in human and in animal populations.<br/>The SARS-CoV virion contains a single-stranded positive polarity 29,700 nucleotide RNA genome bound by the nucleocapsid protein, N. The capsid is surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing at least four structural proteins, designated S, ORF3a, M and E. The SARS-CoV genome contains nine open reading frames (ORFs), the first of which encodes the viral replicase proteins required for subgenomic and genome length RNA synthesis. ORFs 2-8 are encoded in eight subgenomic mRNAs synthesized as a nested set of 3&#8242; co-terminal molecules in which the leader RNA sequences, encoded at the 5&#8242; end of the genome, are joined to body sequences at distinct transcription regulatory sequences (TRS) which contains a highly conserved consensus sequence (CS), ACGAAC in SARS-CoV and ACTAAAC in other group II coronaviruses, respectively. Based on studies with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV likely uses transcription attenuation to synthesize both full length and subgenomic length negative strand RNAs containing antileader sequences, which then function as the templates for the synthesis of like-sized mRNAs (44, 47, 48). It has been well established that alterations in body TRS sequences attenuate expression of individual subgenomic mRNAs while alterations in the leader TRS globally impact the synthesis of all subgenomic mRNAs. Interspaced among the SARS-CoV structural genes are the accessory or group specific genes, ORF3a/b, ORF6, ORF7a/b, ORF8a/b and ORF9b, which are not conserved in other coronaviruses and whose function in replication and pathogenesis are generally unknown. Group specific ORFs encoded in the SARS-CoV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) genome often encode luxury functions for replication in vitro, but may attenuate virulence in vivo (22, 46, 51). The exact functions of the SARS-CoV group specific ORFs are unclear in replication and pathogenesis. Importantly, coronaviruses undergo RNA recombination events at high frequency, presumably because of the large size of the genome, the presence of transcriptionally active full length and subgenomic length templates and a transcription strategy that requires disassociation/reassociation with template strands.<br/>In the present invention, the SARS-CoV transcription network has been globally remodeled by engineering a novel six nucleotide TRS domain that is not present in the genome of SARS-CoV or any other known coronavirus. Studies described herein demonstrate that the recombinant virus, icSARS-CRG, replicates efficiently in cell culture and expressed normal levels of the expected complement of subgenomic mRNAs that encoded both structural and nonstructural proteins. A second recombinant virus, icSARS-PRG, containing a new TRS network that regulated expression of the genome length RNA as well as the subgenomic RNAs encoding essential structural proteins, but not the group specific ORFs 3a/b, ORF6, ORF7a/b and ORF8a/b, also replicated efficiently, demonstrating that the group specific ORFs were not essential for in vitro and in vivo replication. In contrast, chimeras containing a mixture of natural and rewired TRS networks that influenced essential gene expression were lethal. This is the first example of successfully designing new regulatory circuits into the genome of a mammalian virus. These studies serve as a paradigm for designing unique networks of interacting alleles that function as lethal genetic traps following RNA recombination with wild type viruses.<br/>Viruses and Cells. The Urbani and icSARS strains of SARS-CoV (AY278741), icSARS-CoV Luc, icSARS-CoV Luc1, icSARS-CoV Luc-2 and the icSARS-CRG and PRG recombinant viruses were propagated on VeroE6 cells in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, kanamycin (0.25 &#956;g/ml) and gentamycin (0.05 &#956;g/ml) at 37&#176; C. in a humidified CO2 incubator. For virus growth, cultures of VeroE6 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 PFU for 1 hr, the monolayer washed 2&#215; with 2 mls of PBS and overlaid with complete MEM. Virus samples were harvested at different times post infection and titered by plaque assay in 60 mm2 dishes. Plaques were visualized by neutral red staining and counted at 48 hrs. All virus work was performed in a biological safety cabinet in a biosafety level 3 laboratory containing redundant exhaust fans. Personnel were double-gloved and dressed in TYVEK suits with full hoods and face shields. Powered air purifying respirators (PAPR) with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and organic vapor filters were used to provide positive pressure environment within the hoods.<br/>Construction of Renilla Luciferase encoding SARS-CoV Recombinant Clones. Plasmid DNAs were amplified in One Shot&#174; Top 10 chemically competent cells (Invitrogen) and purified with the QIAPREP miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, Calif.). All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs (NEB, Beverly, Mass.) and used according to manufacture's instructions. DNA fragments were isolated from 1.0% agarose gels with the QIAQUICK gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.). All DNA was visualized using DARKREADER technology (Clare Chemical Research, Denver, Colo.) to prevent UV-induced damage that potentially could affect efficacy of assembly at later stages, such as transcription. The six subgenomic cDNA clones (A to F) that include the entire ic SARS genome when combined were isolated using known molecular techniques. ORF 7a/b is located within cDNA F, nucleotides 27273-27772. The Renilla luciferase gene was inserted to replace ORF 7a/b.<br/>Mutations were introduced to the TRS site by utilizing the &#8216;no see'm&#8217; strategy. Three primer sets were designed to amplify three cDNA fragments. A forward primer (Ppum3: 5&#8242;-GCTGTGACATTAAGGACCTGCCAAAAG-3&#8242;; SEQ ID NO:42) extending from the PpumI site was used concurrently with a reverse primer (3MUT3: 5&#8242;-AGGTGCACCTGCAGCCATTTTAATTTATCCGGTTTATGGATA-3&#8242;; SEQ ID NO:43 or 2MUT3: 5&#8242;-AGGTGCACCTGCAGCCATTTTAATTTATCCGTTTTATGGATA-3&#8242;; SEQ ID NO:44) ending at the ORF 7a/b TRS site, which included the appropriate TRS mutations and the outside cutter restriction site for AarI (Fermentas). This resulted in Amplicon 1 (TRS2), by PCR, with three mutations (CCGGAT) in the TRS site and Amplicon 2 (TRS1), with two mutations (ACGGAT) in the TRS site. The third amplicon was created using a forward primer (3MUT5: 5&#8242;-GGTGCACCTGCAAATAAATGGCTTCCA-3&#8242;: SEQ ID NO:45) that overlapped with the previously mentioned AarI site designed into AMP1 and AMP2. The reverse primer (PacI3: 5&#8242;-TAAAGTGAGCTCTTAATTAATTACTGCTCG-3&#8242;; SEQ ID NO:46) ended at the downstream PacI site. This created, by PCR techniques, Amplicon 3 (AMP3). Each amplicon was digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme cocktail: AMP1 and AMP2-PpumI/AarI and AMP3-AarI/PacI. AMP1 and AMP2 were separately ligated to AMP3 for a 1.34 kb cDNA fragment that was subsequently cloned into pTOPO PCR-XL plasmid (Invitrogen). The ic SARS wild type luciferase (icSARS wt-Luc) construct and the new mutated clones were digested with PpuMI and PacI and the 7.91 kb band of the icSARS wt-Luc and the 1.34 kb band of the mutated clones were gel purified and ligated overnight at 4&#176; C. in the presence of 1% T4 DNA Ligase (NEB). Clones with the correct mutations were verified by DNA sequencing with an automated sequencer (UNC-CH Genome Analysis Facility).<br/>Construction of SARS Plasmids Containing Mutated Leader and Intergenic Sequences. To create a leader with the consensus sequence CCGGAT, the SARS A plasmid was PCR amplified with primer set M13R3 (CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC; SEQ ID NO:47) and MuL1-(AAAATCCGGTTAGAGAACAGATCTACAAGAG; SEQ ID NO:48) or MuL1+(CTAACCGGATTTTAAAATCTGTGTAGCTGTC; SEQ ID NO:49) and SARS 453&#8722; (ATAGGGCTGTTCAAGCTGGGG; SEQ ID NO:50). The resulting fragments were combined in an overlapping PCR reaction to create an approximately 620 bp product that was subsequently cloned and sequenced. A plasmid containing the appropriate changes was digested with restriction enzymes MluI and AvrII and this fragment was used to replace the same fragment from the SARS A plasmid. Further sequencing of this plasmid confirmed that it was identical to the SARS A plasmid except for the altered leader. To mutate the spike (S) gene TRS, the SARS E fragment was PCR amplified with either primer set SARS #37 (TGCTGGCTCTGATAAAGGAG; SEQ ID NO:51) and MuSgene&#8722; (NNNCACCTGCACATATCCGGTTAGTTGTTAACAAGAATATCAC; SEQ ID NO:52) or MuSgene+ (NNNCACCTGCAACCGGATATGTTTATTTTCTTATTATTTCTTACTCTC; SEQ ID NO:53) and #10AgeI&#8722; (CATCAAGCGAAAAGGCATCAG; SEQ ID NO:54). These fragments were digested with restriction enzyme AarI, ligated and subcloned. A consensus clone with the desired changes, was digested with BsmBI and AgeI, and used to replace the corresponding fragment in the SARS E plasmid. Next, the SARS F plasmid was PCR amplified with the following sets of primers: SARS #44 (TGATCCTCTGCAACCTGAGC (SEQ ID NO:55) and MuEgene&#8722; (NNNCACCTGCATAAATCCGGACTCACTTTCTTGTGCTTAC; SEQ ID NO:56); MuEgene+ (NNNCACCTGCGTCCGGATTTATGTACTCATTCGTTTCGG; SEQ ID NO:57) and MuMgene&#8722; (NNNCACCTGCAATAGTTAATCCGGTTAGACCAGAAGATCAGGAAC; SEQ ID NO:58); and MuMgene+(NNNCACCTGCGGATTAACTATTATTATTATTCTGTTTGG; SEQ ID NO:59) and 28033&#8722; (TACCAACACCTAGCTATAAGC; SEQ ID NO:60). The three fragments were digested with the restriction enzyme AarI, directionally ligated and subcloned. A clone, containing the new consensus sequence CCGGAT for the E and M genes, was digested with SwaI and NdeI and this fragment was inserted into the SARS F plasmid that had been identically digested. The resulting plasmid was designated FmuEand M. The SARS N gene TRS was mutated by PCR amplifying the F plasmid with primers MuNgene1 (GCTGCATTTAGAGACGTACTTGTTGTTTTAAATAACCGGATAAATTAAAATG TCTGATAATGG; SEQ ID NO:61) and SARS 3&#8242; Ng (TTAATTAATTATGCCTGAGTTGAATCAGCAG; SEQ ID NO:62). The product was digested with BsmBI and used to replace the corresponding section in plasmid FmuEand M, this new plasmid was called FmuE/M/N. Altering the ORF 3a TRS consisted of amplifying plasmid FmuE/M/N with the following primer sets; SARS #44 and SARSX1&#8722; (CGTCTCATGTGTAATGTAATTTGACACCC; SEQ ID NO:63) or SARSX1+ (CGTCTCACACATAACCGGATTTATGGATTTGTTTATGAGATTTTTTAC; SEQ ID NO:64) and 28033&#8722;, and then joining the two fragments using the restriction endonuclease BsmBI. This product was used to replace the SwaI-NdeI portion of FmuE/M/N. Primer sets SARS #47 (GTGCTTGCTGTTGTCTACAG; SEQ ID NO:65) and SARSX3&#8722; (CGTCTCCGTCCG-GGATGTAGCCACAGTGATCTC; SEQ ID NO:66), SARSX3+ (CGTCTCCGGACGCTTTCTT-ATTACAAATTAGGAG; SEQ ID NO:67) and SARSX4&#8722; (CGTCTCTCATATCCGGTTTATGGATAATCTAACTCCATAG; SEQ ID NO:68), and SARSX4+ (CGTCTCATATGAAAATTATTCTCTTCCTGAC; SEQ ID NO:69) and 28033&#8722; were used to generate three PCR fragments that were digested with BsmBI, ligated with T4 DNA ligase and subcloned. A clone containing only the required changes was digested with AvrII and inserted into plasmid FmuE/M/N/X1 that had also been digested with AvrII. Finally, primer set SARS #48 (GGACTTTCAGGATTGCTATTTG; SEQ ID NO:70) and SARSX5&#8722; (CGTCTCATCCGGTTAGACTTTGGTACAAGGTTC; SEQ ID NO:71) and set SARSX5+(CGTCTCCCGGATATGAAACTTCTCATTGTTTTGAC; SEQ ID NO:72) and SARS3&#8242;X5 (NNNTTAATTAATTAATTTGTTCGTTTATTTAAAACAACA; SEQ ID NO:73) created PCR products that were similarly joined using BsmBI and T4 DNA ligase. This product was introduced into plasmid FmuE/M/N/X1/X3/X4 using the NdeI-BstEII restriction sites. This plasmid, named FmuE/M/N/Xorfs, was sequenced to verify all mutations.<br/>Assembly of Full Length cDNAs. The SARS A through F inserts were digested, separated through 0.8% agarose gels, visualized with a DARKREADER lightbox (Claire Chemical), excised and purified using the QIAEX II DNA purification kit. The SARS A+B, C+D and E+F fragments were ligated overnight, and the products isolated (17, 49). The SARS AB+CD+EF fragments were ligated overnight at 4&#176; C., phenol/chloroform extracted and precipitated under isopropyl alcohol. Full-length transcripts were generated in vitro as described by the manufacturer (Ambion, MMESSAGE MMACHINE) with certain modifications. To produce full length capped SARS N gene transcripts, 1 &#956;g of plasmid DNA encoding the SARS N gene was PCR amplified using forward primer (5&#8242;-nnggcctcgatggccatttaggtgacactatagatgtctgataatggaccccaatc-3&#8242;; SEQ ID NO:74) and reverse primer (5&#8242;-nnnttttttttttttttttttttttttttatgcctgattgaatcagcag-3; SEQ ID NO:75) and the amplicons purified from gels. Full length, polyadenylated N gene transcripts were transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase with a 2:1 ratio of cap analog to GTP (Ambion, Austin, Tex.), mixed with full length transcripts and electroporated into cells.<br/>Transfection of Full-Length Transcripts. RNA transcripts were added to 800 &#956;l of the Vero E6 cell suspension (8.0&#215;106) in an electroporation cuvette and four electrical pulses of 450 V at 50 &#956;F were given with a GENE PULSER II electroporator (BioRad) similar to protocols previously described (17, 49). The presence of full length cDNAs and transcripts was verified by separation on agarose gels and visualization by UV light. The transfected Vero cells were seeded in a 75 cm2 flask and incubated at 37&#176; C. for 2 days. Viruses were plaque purified in Vero E6 cells and stock grown in 75 cm2 flasks.<br/>Northern Blot Analysis. Cultures of Vero E6 cells were inoculated with the wild type SARS-CoV Urbani strain and various recombinant viruses at a MOI of 1.0 and incubated for 1 hr at 37&#176; C. At 12 hrs post infection, intracellular RNA was isolated using RiboPure&#8482; reagents as directed by the manufacturer (Ambion, Austin, Tex.). The mRNA was isolated using Qiagen's Oliogtex&#174; (mRNA spin-Column reagents according to the manufacturer's direction (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.). The mRNA was treated with glyoxal and separated on agarose gels using NorthernMax&#174;-Gly according to the manufacturer's directions (Ambion, Austin, Tx). The RNA was transferred to BRIGHTSTAR-PLUS membrane (Ambion) for 4-5 hrs and the RNA cross-linked to the membrane by UV light. The blot was prehybridized and probed with an N gene-specific oligodeoxynucleotide probe (5&#8242;-CTTGACTGCCGCCTCTGCTbTbCCCTbCTbGCb-3; SEQ ID NO:76), where biotinylated nucleotides are designated with a superscript b. Blots were hybridized overnight and washed with low and high stringency buffers as recommended by the manufacturer. Filters were incubated with streptavidin-AP, washed, and then incubated with chemiluminescence substrate CDP-STAR. The blots were overlaid with film and developed.<br/>Western Blot Analysis. Twelve hours post infection, Urbani, icSARS-CoV, icSARS-CoV Luc, icSARS-CoV Luc-1, icSARS-CoV Luc2, icSARS-CRG or icSARS PRG virus infected cells were washed in 1&#215;PBS, lysed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholine, 1% nonidet-p-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), and post nuclear supernatants were added to an equal volume of 5 mM EDTA/0.9% SDS, resulting in a final SDS concentration of 0.5%. Samples were then heat inactivated for 30 minutes at 90&#176; C. in the BL3 facility prior to removal. In a BL2 facility, samples were again heat inactivated for 30 minutes at 90&#176; C. before use. Equivalent sample volumes were loaded onto 4 to 20% Criterion gradient gels (BioRad) and transferred to PVDF membrane (BioRad). For detecting SARS-CoV antigens, lots were probed with polyclonal mouse antisera directed against Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRPs) that expressed the SARS-CoV ORF3a (VRP-ORF3a), S (VRP-S) or N (VRP-N) proteins diluted 1:200 and developed using ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Renilla luciferase expression was verified using antibodies purchased from commercial vendors.<br/>TRS Function in SARS-CoV Transcription. Previous studies using TGEV as a model have established that high fidelity complementary base-pair communication between sequences encoded within the body TRS and the leader TRS encoded in the genome is absolutely essential for efficient expression of coronavirus subgenomic RNAs. As a first step toward remodeling the SARS-CoV TRS network, the nonessential ORF7a/b domain was replaced with the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the ORF7a/b TRS motif (icSARS-CoV Luc). Double (icSARS-CoV Luc1) and triple (icSARS-CoV Luc2) mutations were then engineered in that should disrupt the ORF7a/b TRS communication network in the genome, ablating efficient mRNA 7 subgenomic transcription. Although the wild type SARS-CoV TRS is ACGAAC, the double mutant (TRS1-ACGGAT) and triple mutant (TRS2-CCGGAT) TRS sequences were unique with the latter not being encoded elsewhere in the Urbani genome and not used as a regulatory sequence in any known coronavirus. Recombinant cDNA genomes were assembled as previously described and recombinant viruses isolated by plaque purification. RT-PCR RFLP and sequence analysis demonstrated the appropriate &#916;ORF7a/b and luciferase replacement. Recombinant viruses encoding the luciferase gene replicated as efficiently as wild type virus, achieving titers greater than 107 PFU/ml within 20 hrs post infection, consistent with previous reports that demonstrated that ORF7a/b deletion did not significantly reduce virus replication in vitro or in vivo. In Vero cells, a progressive increase in Renilla luciferase expression was noted over the course of infection that peaked at 4-5 logs above background in icSARS-CoV Luc infected cultures. Under identical conditions, icSARS-CoV Luc-1 and icSARS-CoV Luc-2 displayed significant 90-95% reductions in global levels of luciferase protein expression, respectively over the course of infection. Western blot analysis confirmed the significant reduction in Renilla luciferase expression, but not N protein expression following infection of Vero cells. Further, Northern blot analyses clearly demonstrated that the TRS-1 and TRS-2 motifs significantly ablated expression of subgenomic mRNA 7 encoding luciferase.<br/>Rewiring Coronavirus TRS Transcription Networks. Having demonstrated that the remodeled TRS-2 motif significantly attenuates communication with leader TRS elements and results in significant reductions in subgenomic mRNA synthesis, all of the SARS-CoV TRS elements were changed to the TRS-2 signature (icSARS-CoV CRG). A second mutant was engineered that contained the novel TRS-2 regulatory network, effectively establishing efficient communication between the leader sequence and the four essential structural genes, S, E, M and N (icSARS-PRG). However, this second regulatory network retained the wild type TRS sites that normally regulate expression of the group specific genes ORF3a/b, ORF6, ORF7a/b and ORF8a/b. The inefficient communication between the leader TRS-2 site and wild type TRS sites located just upstream of the group specific genes should significantly attenuate expression of the group specific genes. Recombinant viruses encoding the new TRS-2 and chimeric networks were readily isolated and plaque purified. Recombinant viruses icSARS-CRG and icSARS-PRG both replicated efficiently in Vero cells, approaching titers of mid 107 PFU/ml within 20 hrs post infection, equivalent to wild type viruses. Northern blot analyses revealed appropriately sized subgenomic mRNAs in icSARS-CRG infected cells, typical of wild type SARS-CoV infection. Importantly, subgenomic RNA profiles in icSARS-PRG infected cells displayed the expected set of subgenomic mRNAs encoding the structural genes (mRNA 2, 4, 5 and 9) that were driven from networked TRS-2 sites, but reduced and/or mis-sized subgenomic mRNAs driven from the wild type TRS sites regulating expression of the group specific ORFs. For example, expression of mRNA 3 is reduced by about 50%, while mRNAs 6 and 8 are mis-sized and mRNA 7 is apparently not expressed. Western blot analyses confirmed abundant levels of expression of the structural proteins S and N in all recombinant and wild type viruses, abundant expression of ORF3a in wild type and icSARS-CRG, but little if any expression of ORF3a in icSARS-PRG infected cultures. Analysis of leader-body TRS junctions in wild type and icSARS-CRG revealed usage of the appropriate wild type or mutant TRS sites. In icSARS-PRG, leader-body TRS-2 sites drove expression of subgenomic mRNAs encoding the structural proteins demonstrating efficient communication between networked leader/body TRS sites. The wild type TRS site ACGAAC was rarely used for initiating expression of the group specific ORF encoding subgenomic RNAs. When this was the case, the body TRS sequence was preserved in mRNA consistent with the transcription attenuation model for Nidovirus mRNA synthesis. Most often, upstream and downstream noncanonical TRS sites were typically activated; most likely because they displayed increased homology with TRS-2. Aberrant leader-body junction sites oftentimes result in mRNAs that encode deletions in a group specific ORF or potentially silence group specific ORF expression because new upstream ATG start codons and small ORFs are encoded in the mRNA that are likely recognized and translated by host translational machinery, interfering with efficient translation and expression of the group specific ORF. The data demonstrate that deletion or efficient expression of the group specific ORFs is not essential for SARS-CoV replication in vitro.<br/>Remodeled TRS Networks Encode Lethal Genetic Traps Following RNA Recombination with Wild type Viruses. A series of wild type and chimeric recombinant viruses were engineered as described herein. In the first example, wild type or TRS-2 networks were preserved to efficiently express mRNA 2 encoding the S glycoprotein, but encode the heterologous TRS site for driving expression of the other structural genes (icSARS-Rec1; icSARS-Rec2). In another case, only the N gene TRS site was misaligned with the leader TRS site (icSARS-Rec3).<br/>Full length cDNAs were constructed for wild type icSARS-CoV, icSARS-CRG and the three chimeric recombinant viruses and full length transcripts were electroporated in Vero cells. One-fifth of the electroporated cells were overlaid onto confluent monolayers, allowed to attach for 3 hrs and overlaid with agarose for plaque assay to determine the number of infectious centers. The remaining cells were maintained in complete medium and virus samples and RNA harvested at different times post-electroporation. Approximately 103 infectious centers were detected for icSARS-CoV and icSARS-CRG, but no infectious centers were detected from icSARS-Rec1-3 transfected cultures. Moreover, infectious virus was readily detected, which increased to greater than 107 PFU/ml after about 72 hrs in icSARS-CoV and icSARS-CRG, but no virus was detected in cSARS-Rec 1-3 transfected cultures.<br/>Using RT-PCR, leader-containing transcripts were detected in all wild type and icSARS-CRG transfected cultures at 24 and 48 hrs. These leader-containing transcripts originated at the appropriately networked combination of leader/body TRS sites. In contrast, only low levels of subgenomic mRNA transcripts were detected in icSARS-Rec1-3 transfected cultures at 24 hrs that had mostly disappeared by 48 hrs post-electroporation. Sequence analysis revealed that most leader-containing RNAs originated from noncanonical TRS sites located upstream or more often, downstream of the appropriate start location (FIG. 1A). In many cases, the noncanonical site usage results in large lethal deletions in critical structural genes like M (FIG. 1B) that prevent the production of infectious progeny.<br/>Animal studies. Mice and ferrets are inoculated with 1.0&#215;106 plaque forming units (PFU) of icSARS-CRG and icSARS-PRG. A variety of immune responses (e.g., innate, mucosal, humoral, cellular) are measured according to standard protocols well known in the art at different times postinfection.<br/>Example 6<br/>Secondary Genetic Traps<br/>A TRS consensus sequence (which is the wild type sequence and not a mutation) is engineered into a nidovirus genome or replicon RNA upstream or downstream from the normal TRS consensus sequence (e.g., of an essential structural protein gene such as S, M and/or N) site. This is done by identifying locations that are &#8220;CS-like, e.g., that naturally have 3-5 nucleotides of a six nucleotide CS and that fall just upstream or downstream of the wild type CS. The primary nucleotide sequence is modified at the &#8220;CS-like&#8221; site to be as close to the wild type CS as possible without altering the amino acid sequence of the protein. This modified CS site functions as a site for subgenomic transcription in recombinant virus progeny after recombination with wild type virus. In a resulting recombinant genome, expression of wild type genes is driven from these engineered start sites, resulting in N-terminal truncated proteins and/or out-of-frame ORFs.<br/>In one embodiment, the sequence of the CRG or PRG genome S, M and N genes is analyzed and six nucleotide domains with close homology to the wild type TRS sequence, ACGAAC, are identified and characterized. Close sequence motifs within about 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 or 500 nucleotides (upstream or downstream) of the normal mRNA CS initiation site are identified and those that can be mutated to near exact (5/6 or 6/6) duplicates of the wild type TRS sequence, ACGAAC, are introduced within one or more of the essential gene coding sequences, simultaneously maintaining the normal protein sequence. Following recombination events in which the wild type TRS site is joined to the body of a CRG genome, the secondary trap becomes activated as a preferred site for subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Secondary traps can be introduced in the S, M or N proteins to introduce N-terminal or C-terminal deletions or to introduce out-of-frame ATG starts as the translated product of the subgenomic mRNA. All result in poor expression and/or deleted protein products. Using the sequence of the virus genes, the rewired TRS CS sites and the wild type TRS CS sites, different secondary traps can be introduced into any nidovirus rewired genome of this invention.<br/>In a particular example, the CS of a SARS coronavirus is ACGAAC. Locations nearby this sequence in a structural protein gene (e.g., S, E, M, N) of a rewired genome or a replicon RNA comprising a structural protein gene would be identified that have 4 or 5 of the 6 nucleotides of this CS (e.g., AGGAAG). This site would be changed using standard procedures from AGGAAG to ACGAAC. This site would then be preferentially used when a wild type leader TRS is present in a recombinant virus genome. In an example where the secondary trap is introduced into the S gene, the S protein is truncated by 37 amino acids and a new ATG start site is used to produce a smaller S glycoprotein. The truncated protein functions poorly, resulting in a lethal phenotype.<br/>The foregoing examples are illustrative of the present invention, and are not to be construed as limiting thereof.

His group has published over 300 papers, many in highly visible journals like PNAS, Nature Medicine, Science, PloS Medicine and PloS Pathogens. The Baric laboratory uses genetic, immunologic, molecular and biochemical approaches to study the molecular mechanisms regulating virus replication, pathogenesis, molecular evolution and cross species transmission using emerging coronaviruses, flaviviruses (Dengue) and noroviruses as model systems. We have pioneered new strategies for developing reverse genetic approaches for manipulating the SARS-CoV, SAR-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV genomes and are actively studying the role of multiple genes that function in cross species transmission, virulence, pathogenesis, viral transcription and RNA fidelity. The Baric laboratory is also identifying key neutralizing epitopes in emerging coronaviruses, dengue and noroviruses using human monoclonal antibodies and structure guided immunogen design to develop broadly active vaccines and immunotherapuetics against these pathogens. Finally, his group has developed novel animal models of human disease and identified dozens of host susceptibility loci that regulate emerging CoV pathogenesis.<br/>MEMBER<br/>Kristian G.

The isolate was provisionally called human coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) (3). Shortly thereafter, in September 2012, the same type of virus, named human coronavirus England 1, was recovered from a patient with severe respiratory illness who had been transferred from the Gulf region of the Middle East to London, United Kingdom (4) (GenBank accession no. KC164505.2). The onset of the new disease was traced back to an even earlier time point. Already in April 2012, a cluster of pneumonia cases in health care workers had occurred in an intensive care unit of a hospital in Zarqa, Jordan (5). Two persons died, both of whom were confirmed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus through a retrospective analysis of stored samples (6). These findings met with considerable concern. Although the number of laboratory-confirmed cases is limited (34 as of 12 May 2013), the morbidity and mortality of the infection is alarming, as is its uncanny resemblance&#8212;at least in its clinical features&#8212;to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). While in a small minority of the known cases the patients developed mild disease, most patients presented with a severe acute respiratory condition requiring hospitalization; the mortality rate is approximately 60% (7).<br/>The infection appears to be geographically linked&#8212;at least for now&#8212;to the Middle East, with cases originating from Jordan (n = 2), Saudi Arabia (n = 25), Qatar (n = 2), and the United Arab Emirates (n = 2). Of the three patients known to have contracted the virus outside the Middle East, two became infected in the United Kingdom through contact exposure to an index patient, shortly after the latter returned from a visit to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia (8). Very recently in France, a tourist returning from the United Arab Emirates fell ill and transmitted the infection to at least one other person, with whom he had shared a hospital room (7). Full-length genome sequences determined for three independent virus isolates from Saudi Arabia (3) (GenBank accession no. JX869059.2), Jordan (GenBank accession no. KC776174.1), and the United Kingdom (9) (GenBank accession no. KC164505.2) revealed more than 99% sequence identity (&#8764;100 nucleotide variations in a 30.1-kb genome), indicating that these viruses diverged from a common ancestor very recently.<br/>Go to:<br/>PHYLOGENY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY<br/>Within the subfamily Coronavirinae (10), the novel virus is a representative of a new, yet-to-be-established species in lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus, which currently includes the species Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (Fig. 1) (3). The novel coronavirus seems most closely related to as-yet-unclassified viruses from insectivorous European and African bats in the Vespertilionidae and Nycteridae families, respectively (3, 9, 11&#8211;13). Of note, for the latter viruses, only partial genome sequences are available. The scarce epidemiological data available suggest that the infection is primarily zoonotic in nature, with limited human-to-human transmission. From what we already know of coronavirus biology (14) and from the accumulating evidence for this particular virus (3, 9, 13), bats appear to be the natural host, and it would be tempting to assume that these animals are also the immediate source. However, this idea is difficult to reconcile with the fact that most patients were unlikely to have been exposed directly to bats, or with the close genetic relationship between the human isolates, indicative of a recent bottleneck. A more likely scenario is that a single variant from a spectrum of related betacoronaviruses in bats successfully crossed over to and rapidly established itself in (an) intermediate animal host species (at least in the Middle East), with subsequent incidental spillover into the human population. Such spillover events would be facilitated through frequent intermediate host-human interactions and perhaps through viral adaptations acquired during the initial species jump. Although at present there is no evidence for sustained community transmission, the obvious concern is that the virus may take the next step and adapt to efficient human-to-human transmission.<br/>An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.<br/>Object name is zjv9990978550001.jpg<br/>Fig 1<br/>Phylogenetic relationships among members of the subfamily Coronavirinae and taxonomic position of MERS-CoV. A rooted neighbor-joining tree was generated from amino acid sequence alignments of Coronaviridae-wide conserved domains in replicase polyprotein 1ab (ADRP, nsp3; Mpro, nsp5; RdRP, nsp12; Hel, nsp13; ExoN, nsp14; NendoU, nsp15; O-MT, nsp16) for MERS-CoV strain Hu/Jordan-N3/2012 (GenBank accession no. KC776174.1) and for 20 other coronaviruses, each a representative of a currently recognized coronavirus species (10); equine torovirus Berne served as the outgroup. Virus names are given with strain specifications; species and genus names are in italics as per convention. The tree shows the four main monophyletic clusters, corresponding to genera Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus (color coded) and the position of MERS-CoV. Also indicated are betacoronavirus lineages A through D (corresponding to former CoV subgroups 2A through D). Bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) are indicated at branch points. The tree is drawn to scale (scale bar, 0.2 amino acid substitutions per site).<br/>Go to:<br/>CONSENSUS NAME: MERS-COV<br/>Since the initial discovery, isolates of the virus have been described in the scientific literature, databases, and popular press under various names (e.g., human betacoronavirus 2c EMC, human betacoronavirus 2c England-Qatar, human betacoronavirus 2C Jordan-N3, betacoronavirus England 1) with novel coronavirus (NCoV) as the one used most often. As this lack of uniformity in virus nomenclature complicates communication both in the research field and with health care authorities, governments, and the general public, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (<a href=\"http://ictvonline.org/index.asp?bhcp=1)\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">http://ictvonline.org/index.asp?bhcp=1)</a> took the lead to address this issue. After careful consideration and broad consultation, the CSG has decided to call the new coronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This name is endorsed by the discoverers of the virus and other researchers that pioneered MERS-CoV studies, by the World Health Organization, and by the Saudi Ministry of Health. We strongly recommend the use of this name in scientific and other communications. New MERS-CoV isolates or variants detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR may be provided with an affix, analogous to convention in influenza virus nomenclature (the host/country of origin plus the strain identification number/year; e.g., MERS-CoV Hu/Jordan-N3/2012). As our knowledge of the epidemiology and host preference of this virus is still incomplete, it seems prudent to refrain from labeling MERS-CoV a human coronavirus, at least for the time being.<br/>Go to:<br/>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS<br/>Raoul J. de Groot, Susan C.

Research assessing EID risk has typically focused on identifying geographic regions &#91;3, 4&#93; and wildlife species &#91;5&#8211;7&#93; whereby spillover of zoonotic diseases into humans is most likely. Among recent pandemic zoonotic viruses, some have no evidence of transmission back to wildlife or domestic animal populations after establishment in people (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), while others have repeatedly crossed species boundaries (e.g., pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus) &#91;8, 9&#93;. Evidence of &#8220;reverse zoonotic&#8221; transmission, sometime referred to as &#8220;spillback,&#8221; from people to wildlife and domestic animals is widespread &#91;9&#93;; however, systematic surveys to determine the proportion of EIDs that spill back into novel wildlife hosts are lacking. Infection of bats by viruses of probable human origin has been recorded only twice &#91;10, 11&#93;, and further transmission &#91;12&#93;, or spread to a wider bat population, has not been recorded.<br/>In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was detected from a cluster of 41 atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to cause a pandemic with significant global morbidity, mortality, and economic impact &#91;13&#93;. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that this virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the clade of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) that it belongs in evolved in Old-World bats of the family Rhinolophidae &#91;14&#8211;16&#93;. There is no epidemiological evidence of direct or indirect transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from bats to people, but a full genome of its closest known relative (with 96.2% sequence similarity) was reported from an Intermediate Horseshoe Bat (Rhinolophus affinis) sampled from Yunnan province, China, in 2013 &#91;17&#93;. The timing of SARS-CoV-2 spillover from bats and any involvement of intermediate host species remain undetermined &#91;18, 19&#93;. The United States currently has the highest number of confirmed human cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The consequences of this pandemic are many and include the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to free-ranging wildlife populations. Given the likely bat origin of SARS-CoV-2, free-ranging bats are a key group of concern for spillover from humans. Humans frequently handle and come into close contact with North American temperate-zone bats during the course of ecological research, wildlife rehabilitation, wildlife/pest control, and disease investigations. Anticipating the need for similar risk assessments across many potentially vulnerable species of wildlife and domesticated mammals globally, we here examine the possibility of humans inadvertently infecting free-ranging North American bats with SARS-CoV-2. We further discuss the possible public health and wildlife conservation consequences of SARS-CoV-2 becoming endemic in bats outside its natural host range.<br/>Threats of SARS-CoV-2 to North American bats<br/>The pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 may directly or indirectly threaten North American bat populations in at least three different ways. First, SARS-CoV-2 might infect any of the diverse and historically isolated 40+ endemic species of temperate-zone North American bats, with or without causing disease, morbidity, and mortality. Second, SARS-CoV-2 might infect and become established in one or more North American bat species, creating novel reservoirs capable of causing human infections (e.g., bat rabies lyssaviruses in the New World &#91;20&#93;). Third, if SARS-CoV-2 infection persists in North American bats of one or more species, it could potentially evolve or recombine with endemic viruses &#91;19, 21&#93; to become more pathogenic or infectious to humans or other animals. In addition to new public health challenges, the latter outcomes could quickly shift public perception of bats from mostly beneficial wildlife with associated disease risks that are manageable to bats posing unacceptable disease risks to human and animal health. Such a shift could increase the likelihood of negative human&#8211;bat interactions and conflicts, as well as undermine decades of concerted science, conservation, and education efforts aimed at conserving these valuable animals &#91;22&#8211;24&#93;. The potential threat of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to other animals applies to many species of wildlife and domesticated mammals, but the likely bat origin of SARS-CoV-2 and the current threats to bat populations due to another disease in North America influenced us to focus this review on bats.<br/>Lessons from an epizootic&#8212;Susceptibility of North American bats to an introduced pathogen<br/>SARS-CoV-2 is not the first pathogen with the potential for inadvertent spread from people to North American bats. The COVID-19 pandemic follows the arrival of a fungal pathogen (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) that as early as 2006 began infecting hibernating bat populations in North America, spreading within and among species to alter the evolutionary trajectory of the continent&#8217;s bats &#91;25&#8211;28&#93;. Genetic analyses indicate that P. destructans was introduced to North America &#91;29&#93;, in our opinion likely by movement of humans or materials contaminated with fungal spores. White-nose syndrome (WNS), the disease caused by P. destructans, remains the only documented bat epizootic to cause multiyear, widespread mass mortality &#91;30&#93;, although short-term bat die-offs have been also linked to Lloviu virus in Europe &#91;31&#93;. WNS has killed millions of North American bats, affected populations of at least 12 species of 3 genera, and has already spread across half of the US and Canada (whitenosesyndrome.org, accessed 11 May 2020). Effective methods to mitigate WNS spread and impacts remain elusive despite substantial research effort, and targeted mitigation actions have had limited success against its impacts &#91;32&#93;. It took years of concerted international scientific effort to identify the cold-growing fungus, determine that it likely originated somewhere in the temperate zones of Europe or Asia, understand its mechanisms of infection and pathogenicity, develop strategies to limit accidental translocation, and track its rapid spread through an immunologically na&#239;ve continental assemblage of hibernating bats &#91;33&#8211;35&#93;.<br/>The devastating impact of WNS on a diverse group of North American bats likely resulted from evolutionary isolation of the continent&#8217;s bat fauna from other parts of the world for millions of years, despite other species of Pseudogymnoascus being present. Bats in both Europe and Asia can become infected by P. destructans but do not suffer mass mortality from WNS &#91;36, 37&#93;. The bat fauna spanning the higher latitudes of North America (in the US and Canada) is composed almost entirely of endemic species belonging to the family Vespertilionidae. Vespertilionid bats occur globally but likely originated and diversified in North America tens of millions of years ago before dispersing to other continents &#91;38, 39&#93;. No extant species of bat in the Americas also occurs outside of the Americas &#91;40, 41&#93;, and no bats migrate across the Pacific or Atlantic Oceans &#91;42, 43&#93;. The WNS epizootic demonstrates that a large proportion of these historically isolated bats can be vulnerable to a pathogen introduced from another continent during a single event. Additionally, bats already in a physiologically stressed condition due to WNS or other pressures may be more susceptible to viral infection, experience exacerbated disease outcomes, and/or experience increased viral shedding &#91;44, 45&#93;. The COVID-19 pandemic resembles WNS with respect to potential spread of a pathogen from another continent through interconnected, multispecies assemblages of North American bats that might be immunologically na&#239;ve and highlights deficits in our understanding of temperate-zone bat pathogens in North America.<br/>Gaps in understanding global patterns of Bat&#8211;CoV diversity, evolution, and host range<br/>Bats are among the world&#8217;s most diverse mammals (comprising approximately 1,400 species &#91;46&#93;), and the global distribution and diversity of CoVs in bats proportionally reflects that of their hosts &#91;47, 48&#93;. Available evidence indicates that bats are natural reservoirs of CoVs, some of which have the potential to cause diseases in humans, domesticated animals, and wildlife &#91;17, 47, 49&#8211;59&#93;. Coronaviruses appear to have ancient and ancestral relationships with bats, diversifying globally through a process of within-host evolution and cross-taxonomic host-switching events &#91;47, 59&#8211;61&#93;. Bats are the likely mammalian progenitor hosts of all alpha (&#945;-) and beta (&#946;-) CoVs &#91;58, 59, 62, 63&#93; and potentially all coronaviruses &#91;60&#93;. Alpha-CoVs of likely bat origin include the causative agent of swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS), which caused mass mortality of over 25,000 piglets on farms in Guangdong province, China &#91;57&#93;, and a variant strain of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) that spread rapidly from China in recent decades and caused mass piglet mortality in multiple US states &#91;64&#93;. Human CoVs NL63 and 229E also likely had their evolutionary origins in bats &#91;59, 65&#93;. Two recent human disease epidemics (severe acute respiratory syndrome &#91;SARS&#93; and Middle East respiratory syndrome &#91;MERS&#93;) and now the current COVID-19 pandemic are caused by viruses that probably originated from &#946;-CoVs circulating in bat populations in regions where outbreaks occurred &#91;17, 19, 50&#8211;54, 58, 66&#8211;68&#93;.<br/>The emergence of diseases like SADS, PEDV, SARS, MERS, and now COVID-19 strongly indicates a close association between CoVs that become pathogenic in humans and the wildlife reservoirs from which they originate &#91;17, 50&#8211;54, 67&#93;. The evolutionary relationships of CoVs within bats are consistent with geographically structured transmission cycles, with occasional transmission among related bat species &#91;47, 58, 69&#93;. These phylogeographic factors are also universal determinants of viral sharing among all mammals &#91;70&#93;. However, bat&#8211;virus association patterns can be particularly difficult to discern because bats often roost together in multispecies aggregations that can facilitate viral sharing, with each species capable of harboring multiple CoV lineages &#91;47, 58, 68, 71&#93;. Host shifts from bats to more divergent taxa are more difficult to predict&#8212;firstly, because the potential host breadth for many CoVs is broad &#91;55, 56, 60, 72&#93;, and secondly, because host susceptibility and onward transmission involve complex, multistage processes &#91;2, 12&#93;. Bat&#8211;CoV associations likely remain substantially undersampled and understudied in temperate-zone North America &#91;47, 71, 73, 74&#93;.<br/>Are viruses like SARS-CoV-2 already present in North American bats?<br/>Our examination of CoV evolutionary lineages and global distribution patterns of the diversity of bat species they infect suggests that temperate-zone North American bats could be immunologically na&#239;ve to infection by viruses like SARS-CoV-2. Alpha and &#946;-CoVs have been detected in bats on most continents, sometimes with both types occurring in bats of the same species &#91;58, 68&#93;. However, an exception to this pattern is the lack of published evidence that &#946;-CoVs infect bats of temperate-zone North America, despite several search efforts which used methods suitable to detect both &#945;- and &#946;-CoVs &#91;59, 71, 74, 75&#93;. Multiple novel &#945;-CoVs have been detected and described in vespertilionid bats of the US and Canada, infecting species both living in close contact with humans and in remote wild areas &#91;59, 71, 74&#8211;76&#93;. However, SARSr-CoVs and &#946;-CoVs of the viral subgenus Sarbecovirus have thus far been detected almost exclusively in species of the Old-World Chiropteran suborder Yinpterochiroptera (Fig 1A) &#91;47, 58, 69&#93;. The few exceptions to this pattern are the detection of novel Clade 3 and Clade 1 Sarbecovirus (sensu &#91;53&#93;) viruses in the wrinkle-lipped free-tailed bat (Mops plicatus, family Molossidae) in China &#91;77&#93; and the vespertilionid Leisler's noctule (Nyctalus leisleri) cohabiting a Bulgarian cave during autumn with several species of rhinolophids in which other SARSr &#946;-CoVs were concurrently detected, suggesting cross-species infections (Fig 1A) &#91;78&#93;. Putative detections of a Clade 1 Sarbecovirus were also reported from guano samples of the vespertilionid brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and the molossid European free-tailed bat (Tadarida teniotis) on Sardinia, where the same novel &#946;-CoV was described in the greater horseshoe bat (R. ferrumequinum) &#91;79&#93;.<br/>thumbnail&#9;Download:<br/>PPTPowerPoint slide<br/>PNGlarger image<br/>TIFForiginal image<br/>Fig 1.

These widely distributed MERS-like viruses can cause disease in humans (e.g., MERS) and notably appear to be the only bat &#946;-CoVs to diversify among several families of the globally distributed suborder Yangochiroptera (Fig 1D) &#91;47, 58, 69&#93;.<br/>Lack of evidence for &#946;-CoVs in temperate-zone North American bats<br/>The several hundred species of extant bats spanning the Americas all belong to the suborder Yangochiroptera, which likely diverged from the Old-World suborder Yinpterochiroptera more than 50 million years ago (Fig 2) &#91;80&#93;. The only &#946;-CoVs detected in the Americas to date belong to the subgenus Merbecovirus and appear restricted to two exclusively Neotropical bat families (Phyllostomidae and Mormoopidae) and one that is globally distributed (Molossidae). Distinct CoV lineages in the subgenus Merbecovirus were described from three species of Pteronotus (family Mormoopidae), four species of Artibeus, and Seba&#8217;s short-tailed bat (Carollia perspicillata; family Phyllostomidae) from tropical regions of Mexico &#91;47, 81&#93;. Novel &#946;-CoVs of the subgenus Merbecovirus were detected in two neotropical bat species of the family Molossidae: Wagner&#8217;s bonneted bat (Eumops glaucinus) in southern Brazil and the broad-eared free-tailed bat (Nyctinomops laticaudatus) in southern Mexico &#91;81, 82&#93;. In vitro infections have shown that primary kidney cells from the Jamaican fruit-eating bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) can be infected with MERS-CoV, and virus replication and shedding was reported in experimentally infected bats of this species but without obvious clinical signs of disease &#91;83&#93;. Similar to the evidence for natural invasion of bat rabies viruses among New World bats &#91;84&#93;, available evidence suggests &#946;-CoVs may have arrived through South America and have long been evolving in Neotropical bats. Although some bat hosts of Merbecoviruses overlap geographically with species of temperate-zone North American bats, none occur outside of the Neotropics. Sampling has been limited, but we are not aware of any published detections of Merbecoviruses or any other &#946;-CoVs in temperate-zone North American vespertilionid bats.<br/>thumbnail&#9;Download:<br/>PPTPowerPoint slide<br/>PNGlarger image<br/>TIFForiginal image<br/>Fig 2.

Yet SARSr-CoVs (Sarbecovirus spp.), a focus of many surveillance efforts, have been almost exclusively documented in Old-World Yinpterochiroptera. SARSr-CoVs were only found in the ultra-diverse and globally distributed bat suborder Yangochiroptera under conditions with plausible transmission from co-roosting Rhinolophus sp. bats &#91;53, 85&#93;. This absence of evidence for SARS-like &#946;-CoVs in yangochiropteran bats in general, and in temperate-zone vespertilionid bats of North America in particular, likely represents a unique biogeographic pattern driven by underlying factors of host susceptibility or life history. These observations also point to the susceptibility of vespertilionid bats under circumstances of SARSr-CoV environmental exposure and that they may not be naturally immune to these viruses.<br/>Bats rank among the most ecologically important mammals and play varied roles in most of Earth&#8217;s ecosystems; bats pollinate and disperse seeds of numerous plants in tropical regions, and all over the world, bats are primary nocturnal predators of flying insects &#91;23, 24&#93;. Across the Holarctic, chiropteran species diversity is greatest among hibernating vespertilionid bats. At least 25 of the ecologically diverse vespertilionid species of bats in the US and Canada hibernate &#91;86&#93;, which might influence their susceptibility to or interactions with viruses, as has been postulated for common vespertilionids infected with &#945;-CoVs and rabies virus &#91;44, 87&#8211;89&#93;. Hibernation strategies vary among species of bats (e.g., degree of sociality, thermoregulatory behaviors, habitat selection) &#91;90&#93;, but bat body temperatures during hibernation generally remain consistently below 10&#186; C for periods lasting 7&#8211;9 months per year &#91;91&#93;, providing a potential mechanism to limit viral replication and spread &#91;92&#93;. Experimental studies to assess the ability of SARS-CoV-2 or other &#946;-CoVs to survive and replicate in bats (cell lines and individuals) at low temperatures &#91;92, 93&#93; would provide additional insight into risk of reverse zoonosis. However, appropriate tools for studying such possibilities are lacking, particularly immortalized cell lines from several hibernating, vespertilionid bats &#91;59&#93;. These tools would also enable interrogation of other physiological features of vespertilionids that may influence susceptibility, such as receptor-binding affinity and the expression of receptors across tissues. Scientists did not discover and isolate the obligately psychrophilic fungus that causes WNS until they collected samples in bat hibernation sites and moved culture dishes for incubation into laboratory refrigerators &#91;25&#93;. Similar innovative explorations outside the typical temperature conditions of laboratory experimentation could help assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infecting the more than two dozen species of bats in the US and Canada that hibernate to survive harsh temperate-zone winters.<br/>Proactively connecting the wellbeing of human and bat populations<br/>Scientists have long recognized the risk of pathogen spillover from humans to bats &#91;94&#8211;96&#93;, but bat researchers in North America have not systematically addressed this risk prior to WNS. Outside of reservoir host studies, few bat researchers studied infectious diseases in bats before WNS emerged in 2007 &#91;73&#93; nor studied bat viruses (other than rabies) before bats were retrospectively connected to the SARS epidemic &#91;15, 66, 97&#93;. Fortunately, bat and wildlife disease researchers recently began addressing these knowledge gaps in more detail &#91;7, 97, 98&#93;. Possible explanations for why bats might host particularly pathogenic viruses include characteristics of their life history (e.g., long-lived, wide ranging, multispecies aggregations, daily and seasonal heterothermy) &#91;97&#93;, unique physiology for repairing their damaged DNA &#91;99&#93;, unique ability to suppress some of their innate immunity pathways &#91;100&#8211;105&#93;, high species diversity &#91;48&#93;, and unmatched metabolic range and high body temperatures during flight &#91;106&#93;. Bats also cryptically come into close contact with humans, increasingly in urban and periurban settings as a result of native habitat loss, often crossing human&#8211;wildlife interfaces &#91;107&#8211;113&#93;.<br/>Except for Lyssavirus infections, bats rarely show substantial signs of sickness from the same pathogens that cause virulent disease in humans. Bats cope with viral infections in ways that we do not yet fully comprehend, but learning how they do so may reveal important insights to develop therapeutics and ultimately to protect human health &#91;103&#8211;105&#93;. In vitro and laboratory studies demonstrate that bats can specifically regulate na&#239;ve immunity pathways to effectively cope with viral infection &#91;114&#93;. For example, dendritic cells generated from the bone marrow of the Egyptian rousette (Rousettus aegyptiacus) infected with Marburg virus down-regulate immune-stimulatory pathways and maturation of cells targeted by the virus while up-regulating pathogen-sensing pathways &#91;115&#93;. Unique bat immune regulation may occur with MERS-CoV infection, at least under experimental conditions &#91;101&#93;. Egyptian rousette bats experimentally challenged with SARS-CoV-2 by intranasal inoculation became transiently infected, shed virus, and one cohoused bat became infected but showed no clinical signs of disease other than rhinitis &#91;116&#93;. Our potential lack of understanding of clinical signs of illness in bats and the cryptic habits of many species also generally inhibit our ability to easily detect spillover of pathogens from human to bat populations. This may add to uncertainty about cross-species transmission and dispersal of CoVs among human and animal communities. Laboratory findings suggest human viruses that likely originated in bats, such as HCoV-NL63, are capable of infecting bat cells, at least in vitro &#91;59&#93;. SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs have some of the longest genomes among all RNA viruses, and despite having specialized RNA proofreading machinery &#91;117, 118&#93;, they are still prone to recombination and copy errors in hosts, sometimes resulting in functional adaptations (e.g., altered receptor binding capacity or temperature adaptation of enzymes) &#91;119&#93;. CoVs can even recombine with functional fragments of other virus families, such as when a bat-derived CoV gained a functional gene from a reovirus &#91;21&#93;. Spillover of SARS-CoV-2 from infected humans to North American bats they handle or come in close contact with could lead to the virus becoming either less or more pathogenic to bats or other wildlife, domesticated animals, or humans through genetic mixing in one or more novel hosts. The public health and conservation consequences of a more virulent virus could be severe, whereas genetic mixing in a bat host that resulted in a less-virulent virus might go unnoticed.<br/>Need for an interdisciplinary response<br/>Effectively managing risks of human disease caused by emerging zoonotic pathogens and ensuring the health and conservation of wildlife species that are potential reservoirs of those disease agents can be synergistic goals under a One Health framework. Spillover risk (from or to wildlife) is often greatest in disturbed ecosystems where there is an elevated frequency of human&#8211;wildlife interactions or disruption of ecological patterns &#91;3, 120&#8211;124&#93;. Thus, effective bat conservation and management requires understanding both pathogens that cause disease in bats, as well as human activities and ecological contexts that increase direct and indirect interactions with bats that could present health risks &#91;2&#93;. Furthermore, fear-based reactions to disease risk from wildlife, such as culling infected bat populations or indiscriminate killing, often have negative unintended consequences for the interconnected health of both humans and bats (e.g., culling of bats in a Uganda mine led to a more than doubling of Marburg virus prevalence in the bats living there) &#91;30, 125&#8211;127&#93;. Temperate-zone vespertilionid bats inhabiting human dwellings in the US and Canada represent a particularly relevant human&#8211;wildlife interface, in which conservation and management actions to proactively address the potential consequences for pathogen spillover are worth careful consideration &#91;73&#93;.<br/>Conservation-compatible surveillance of bat viruses has demonstrated the potential for mutually beneficial collaboration between public health scientists and conservation stakeholders &#91;94, 113, 125, 128, 129&#93;. Disease-focused studies that integrate ecological principles into a rigorous study design provide the most informative context to interpret bat&#8211;virus associations and patterns of richness globally &#91;130&#8211;132&#93;. Assessing the risks of SARS-CoV-2 spillover into North American bats presents a timely opportunity to form multidisciplinary scientific teams that include experts on emerging infectious diseases and ecologists with expertise on North American bats &#91;128&#93;. Scientists researching emerging infectious diseases can benefit from sampling opportunities and methods that bat researchers have developed for observing, counting, and noninvasively sampling bats &#91;73, 133&#93;. Bat researchers can learn about human and animal health monitoring and supporting laboratory methods, including biosafety, secure handling/transport of CoV-positive samples, and training in the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) from professionals with expertise in veterinary and medical sciences &#91;113, 131, 134, 135&#93;. A shared goal of all stakeholders is to identify and implement simple, widely available diagnostic tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection that are species-independent, practical for field and laboratory use, highly specific and sensitive, and that do not require strict biosafety containment &#91;136&#93;. All investigators can also work together to develop mutually beneficial goals, such as joint risk communications to the public with effective and balanced messaging about bat populations and higher risk activities for human&#8211;bat contact.<br/>Adopting a precautionary approach in the face of global COVID-19 transmission among human populations, national and international wildlife organizations have advised limiting capturing and handling of bats in the field to minimize the risk of humans infecting wild bats with SARS-CoV-2 until further assessment can be made &#91;137, 138&#93;. The emergence of WNS in 2007 prompted a similar surge in interdisciplinary collaboration that enabled the rapid advances already mentioned and introduced changes to guidance for PPE use and disinfection practices for bat researchers and recreational cavers. Similarly, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses will likely alter the status quo of bat research, emphasizing the need to carefully weigh risks and benefits of wildlife research in the context of population-altering diseases. For example, PPE, including respiratory protection, is a standard practice adopted by many bat virus researchers but by few others studying and regularly handling bats &#91;134, 139&#93;. The urgent research priority of a rapid, quantitative risk assessment and analysis of various mitigation options is currently underway &#91;137, 140&#93;. One key question is whether the proper use of optimal PPE, including bidirectional N95 or equivalent masks, along with effective risk communication and adherence to other basic biosafety practices &#91;134, 141, 142&#93; during field work, can significantly reduce the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to bats. In the interim, until new guidelines are established for handling and for close-proximity work with bats, we have outlined gaps in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 spillover risks at the interface between humans, domesticated animals, and free-ranging wildlife. Temporarily shifting to &#8220;hands-off&#8221; bat research methods also seems prudent, wherever possible, and could facilitate ongoing work with reduced risk.<br/>Examples of &#8220;hands-off&#8221; research strategies<br/>Multiple research strategies that do not involve close contact with free-ranging bats already exist for addressing critical gaps in understanding CoV diversity, distribution, evolution, and potential health effects in temperate-zone bats. For example, a combination of host-cell receptor analyses and in vitro and in vivo experimental infections across a diversity of bat and other mammalian species have helped inform potential host range expansion for SARS-CoV-2. The receptors that many CoVs use to gain access to host cells, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4/CD26), have undergone positive selection in bats, resulting in diverse and recombinant CoV strains &#91;72, 143&#93;. These strains can likely bind to numerous variants of a host receptor protein and facilitate spillover into other animal species &#91;72, 144&#93;. SARS-CoV-2 targets and strongly binds to mammalian ACE2 cell receptors &#91;72, 145, 146&#93;. Beta-CoVs of the subgenus Merbecovirus (like those known to occur in the Americas) are not known to target ACE2 cell receptors, instead using as a receptor DPP4/CD26 or possibly other receptors &#91;53, 144&#93;. Current in silico predictions that bats will likely have low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 based on ACE2 structural analyses conflict with in vitro evidence and do not comprehensively account for ACE2 amino acid sequence variation (including intraspecific variation) that occurs within bats &#91;17, 72, 145&#93;. Assessing SARS-CoV-2 host range will require additional virus-host receptor binding assays in silico and in vitro &#91;17, 53, 72, 144, 145&#93;, together with future experimental infection studies for confirmation of Koch&#8217;s postulates. In addition, in vitro studies could evaluate species variability in innate immune responses. These investigations will help quantify the potential for North American bat infection and transmission among free-ranging populations.<br/>Examples of other &#8220;hands-off&#8221; methods applicable to both bat disease and conservation research include the following: virus discovery and characterization focused on existing specimens archived in scientific museums or through partnerships and collaboration with established national bat disease monitoring or surveillance programs &#91;147, 148&#93;; monitoring echolocation calls to determine the occurrence, distributions, and seasonal or nightly activity patterns of bats &#91;133, 149&#93;; digital imaging methods for counting bats and studying physiology and behaviors in the context of disease &#91;90, 108&#93;; sampling guano from below bat roosts to determine bat species and individual identity, population dynamics, and daily or seasonal patterns of bat occupancy and pathogen shedding &#91;71, 150&#8211;152&#93;; and mathematical modeling to predict susceptible host species, virus sharing among hosts, spread patterns, or to estimate mortality in affected populations &#91;5, 70, 122, 135&#93;. Promising areas for innovation include making technologies for bat research more accessible to a broader global user base, less expensive, easier to use, and scientifically reproducible through open-source hardware, software, and laboratory methods &#91;153, 154&#93;. In addition to research, standardized field protocols and probabilistic sampling strategies are needed for monitoring bats and their viruses at continental scales (www.nabatmonitoring.org) &#91;155, 156&#93;, as are longitudinal studies across multiple sites to better understand the ecological drivers of CoV dynamics and spillover &#91;157&#93;. Developing simple management tools and methods for rapidly assessing risks of virus spillover from humans to wildlife, while maintaining scientific rigor, could also help with future disease response. It might also be useful to prepare a suite of tools, protocols, and risk communication strategies for natural resource managers and public health officials to immediately deploy while risks are being assessed. Such prepared management resources could include public outreach material and guidelines for enhanced use of PPE for those in closest contact with potentially susceptible wildlife.<br/>Conclusion<br/>Many questions remain about the risk of SARS-CoV-2 to na&#239;ve wildlife populations, the influences of human behavior on those risks, and the potential for establishment of new CoV reservoirs. Cross-species virus transmission events are relatively rare, requiring an infectious reservoir host to be in contact with a recipient host when conditions concurrently favor susceptibility and onward transmission &#91;12, 113, 114&#93;. The currently unknown, but possible and potentially high-consequence, risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and establishment in North American bats (or other free-ranging mammals) warrants precaution &#91;116, 140&#93;. Strategically managing interactions between people and potentially susceptible or at risk species can decrease the probability of cross-species virus spillover &#91;113&#93;. Humans that frequently handle and come into close contact with North American temperate-zone bats, such as bat researchers, wildlife rehabilitators, wildlife/pest control workers, and disease investigators, can help decrease any chances of spillover by adopting basic PPE and biosafety practices and carefully evaluating how their actions might adversely affect bat populations. We are at a critical nexus of biosecurity and natural resource conservation that will require ingenuity and diligence to continue important research on bats whilst simultaneously evaluating the ecological future of SARS-CoV-2. Our actions during this current pandemic could profoundly influence and protect the health of both humans and wildlife in North America.<br/>Supporting information<br/>Global patterns of betacoronavirus (&#946;-CoV) associations in bats.<br/>Skip to figshare navigation<br/>A&#9;B&#9;C&#9;D&#9;E&#9;F&#9;G&#9;H&#9;I<br/>1&#9;&#946;-CoV SUBGENERA&#9;BAT SPECIES&#9;BAT FAMILY&#9;REGION&#9;REFERENCE&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;<br/>2&#9;Sarbecovirus&#9;Rhinolophus affinis&#9;Rhinolophidae&#9;Asia&#9;He B, Zhang Y, Xu L, Yang W, Yang F, Feng Y, et al.

Many of EcoHealth Alliance's international collaborations with in-country organizations and institutions fall under the PREDICT umbrella. Scientists in the field collect samples from local fauna in order to track the spread of potential harmful pathogens and to stop them from becoming outbreaks. Scientists also train local technicians and veterinarians in animal sampling and information gathering.<br/>Active Countries: Bangladesh, Cameroon, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Liberia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, South Sudan, Thailand, Uganda, Vietnam<br/>IDEEAL<br/>IDEEAL (Infectious Disease Emergence and Economics of Altered Landscapes Program)&#91;25&#93; seeks to study the impact deforestation and land-use change have in Sabah, Malaysia in regards to increased risk of zoonoses. This work is centered in particular around the local palm oil industry. The project also suggests sustainable alternatives to large-scale deforestation to the country's business leaders and its policy-makers. The program is based at the Development Health Research Unit (DHRU) in Malaysia, cofounded with the Malaysian University of Sabah.<br/>Rift Valley Fever Virus<br/>Rift Valley fever (RVFV) has wreaked havoc on the livestock industry in sub-Saharan Africa where it is most prominent. EcoHealth Alliance is working in South Africa to better predict outbreaks by studying the impact of environment and human behavior in regards to the mosquito-spread virus. EcoHealth Alliance is also already at work with policymakers on a plan should RVFV spread to the United States.<br/>Bat Conservation<br/>A growing body of research indicates that bats are an important factor in both ecosystem health, and disease emergence. A number of hypotheses have been proposed for the high number of zoonoses that have come from bat populations in recent decades. One group of researchers hypothesized &#8220;that flight, a factor common to all bats but to no other mammals, provides an intensive selective force for coexistence with viral parasites through a daily cycle that elevates metabolism and body temperature analogous to the febrile response in other mammals. On an evolutionary scale, this host-virus interaction might have resulted in the large diversity of zoonotic viruses in bats, possibly through bat viruses adapting to be more tolerant of the fever response and less virulent to their natural hosts.&#8221; &#91;26&#93;<br/>Project Deep Forest<br/>According to the FAO, roughly 18 million acres of forest are lost every year due to deforestation,&#91;27&#93; an area roughly the size of Panama. Increased contact between humans and the animal species whose habitat is being destroyed has led to increases in zoonotic disease. EcoHealth Alliance scientists are testing species for pathogens in areas with very little, moderate, and complete deforestation in order to track potential outbreaks. This data is used to promote the preservation of natural lands and diminish the devastating effects of land-use change."},{"id":365,"title":"Fauci Leaked E-Mails","group":"Document","image":"img/Fauci_Leaked_E-Mails.png","value":1,"notes":""},{"id":366,"title":"Peter Daszak","group":"Person","image":"img/Peter_Daszak.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://www.globalviromeproject.org/who-we-are/leadership/peter-daszak\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://www.globalviromeproject.org/who-we-are/leadership/peter-daszak</a><br/>PETER DASZAK serves as the Treasurer and Secretary of the Global Virome Project Leadership Board.

This includes identifying the bat origin of SARS, the drivers of Nipah virus emergence, publishing the first global emerging disease &#8216;hotspots&#8217; map, discovering SADS coronavirus, designing a strategy to identify the number of unknown viruses in wildlife, identifying the first case of a species extinction due to disease, and discovering the disease chytridiomycosis as the cause global amphibian declines. He is one of the founders of the field of Conservation Medicine and has been instrumental in the growth of EcoHealth, One Health, and now Planetary Health.<br/>A fundamental part of the Peter&#8217;s work on disease ecology is directed by the conviction that disease outbreaks are not just predictable, but preventable. This approach is informed by a perspective on emerging infectious disease research that sees problems of human and animal disease as intimately linked &#8211; exacerbated by ecological change. With this in mind, he led the research that produced the first ever global emerging disease &#8216;hotspots&#8217; map to determine where in the world viruses with pandemic potential are most likely to emerge, and developed a strategy to identify just how many of those viruses currently exist.<br/>Peter is a member of the National Academy of Medicine and Chair of the NASEM&#8217;s Forum on Microbial Threats.

Below is the report on this effort. <br/>Bellagio Initiative on the Global Virome Project (GVP)<br/>1.  The Global Virome Project (GVP) Bellagio forum attendees (see list below) support the development of a global alliance to carry forward the GVP, an international effort to identify and characterize, within a decade, 99% of all zoonotic viruses with epidemic/pandemic potential in order to better predict, prevent, and respond to future viral pandemic threats and to protect us all from their worst consequences.<br/>WHY THE STATUS QUO ISN&#8217;T ACCEPTABLE<br/>2.  We, the attendees, recognize that we live in an interconnected world where a single lethal microbe could emerge suddenly and rapidly spread to every household and every community without regard to national borders, or to social and economic standing.<br/>3.  We are equally aware that global trends indicate that over the course of this century, the rate that new microbial threats emerge will continue to accelerate due to growing socioeconomic and demographic factors largely driven by the world&#8217;s increasing population and increasing interactions with animal populations.<br/>4.  We recognize that our responses to the SARS, pandemic influenza, MERS, Ebola, and Zika outbreaks illustrate that the world needs to do better to either mitigate the impact of an emerging threat or to prevent its emergence. <br/>5.  We also know that the majority and growing proportion of epidemics are zoonotic and that the common thread across nearly all of the high-impact emerging disease threats is that they are viral.  While bacteria, particularly those that have acquired resistance to antimicrobials, and parasites and fungi can also pose serious threats to global health, addressing viruses has emerged as a critical need in improving global health.<br/>A GLOBAL VISION<br/>6.  Fortunately, rapid advances in science and a corresponding revolution in technologies allow us to foresee a world where the impact of future pandemics can be minimized.<br/>7.  With this knowledge comes the ability to move away from a reactionary approach to these threats to a strategy that focuses ever more on both accurate modeling for better prediction and robustly on prevention.<br/>8.  What is required is bold global action that embraces a near-term time horizon for an international &#8216;big science&#8217; project akin to the Human Genome and Project.<br/>9.  The GVP offers such a vision, though it requires much greater distributive capacity and engagement by sovereign states around the world for such action.<br/>10.  At the core of GVP&#8217;s vision is that within 10 years almost all of the planet&#8217;s zoonotic viral threats will have been identified and characterized, and a comprehensive database built in order to design science-based surveillance, preparedness, and prevention plans, enabling the development of appropriate countermeasures well in advance of future epidemic events. <br/>11.  The GVP aims at achieving this vision through core principles that:<br/>Embrace an international scope, while fostering local ownership<br/>Promote equitable access to data and benefits<br/>Foster transparency<br/>Assist countries in building their national capabilities for &#8220;prevention, detection and response&#8221; for emerging viral threats in all partner countries on an unprecedented scale<br/>Foster global ownership through an international alliance<br/>A DRAMATIC STEP TOWARDS BUILDING THE SYSTEMS AND CAPACITIES FOR THE FUTURE<br/>12.  The success of the GVP will be measured by its deliverables, which in the course of its 10-year lifespan will include:<br/>Detecting and identifying at least 99% of potential zoonotic viral threats to human health and food security;<br/>Characterizing the host range of the detected viruses (reservoirs and transmission hosts);<br/>Determining the geographic distribution and ecologic scope of nearly all zoonotic viruses to inform on risk and surveillance in human and animals;<br/>Promoting the monitoring of the movement of detected viruses across hosts and regions;<br/>Improving the assessment of the risk of spillover and epidemic potential;<br/>Prioritizing high-risk viruses for further characterization, surveillance targeting, research, and mitigation development;<br/>Strengthening global surveillance networks through local and global capacity enhancements (e.g. surveillance, field biology, lab proficiencies, biosafety);<br/>Enabling in-country/regional laboratory and surveillance capacities to monitor for high-risk viruses across animal-human interfaces;<br/>Establishing sample biobank(s) for further research;<br/>Creating open-access databases that include sequence and metadata;<br/>Making data and samples available for public health risk assessments and mitigation, as well as further detailed pathogen studies;<br/>Providing new insights into virus and host biology, conservation and ecology;<br/>Identifying markers for transmission and pathogenicity for high-risk viruses; and<br/>Establishing an ethical framework for sample, data, information, and benefit sharing, including authorship and intellectual property.<br/>ADDITIONAL BENEFITS<br/>13.  The GVP has the big science potential to be truly transformative &#8211; triggering advances in science and global health beyond its targeted scope.  <br/>14. Characterizing the global zoonotic viral diversity and ecology would also result in a wide range of advances in human and animal health, including the development of critical new technologies and diagnostics, risk mitigation strategies, and eventually advances in vaccines and therapeutics. <br/>15.  Like the Human Genome Project, the GVP will likely lead to unrelated and often unexpected advances in human and animal health and in science.<br/>THE BEGINNING OF THE END<br/>16.  With global support for the Global Virome Project, the world will be better prepared to deal with the consequences of escalating spillover of deadly viruses in ten years.<br/>17.  Further, this initiative will enable the identification of populations with the greatest vulnerability to novel pathogenic viruses and the highest risk interactions with animal populations, enabling mitigation measures to be targeted with unparalleled accuracy, protecting populations from future pandemics.<br/>18.

He oversees an extensive portfolio of basic and applied research to prevent, diagnose, and treat established infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis and malaria as well as emerging diseases such as Ebola and Zika. NIAID also supports research on transplantation and immune-related illnesses, including autoimmune disorders, asthma and allergies. The NIAID budget for fiscal year 2020 is an estimated $5.9 billion.<br/>Dr. Fauci has advised six presidents on HIV/AIDS and many other domestic and global health issues. He was one of the principal architects of the President&#8217;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a program that has saved millions of lives throughout the developing world.<br/>Dr. Fauci also is the longtime chief of the Laboratory of Immunoregulation. He has made many contributions to basic and clinical research on the pathogenesis and treatment of immune-mediated and infectious diseases. He helped pioneer the field of human immunoregulation by making important basic scientific observations that underpin the current understanding of the regulation of the human immune response. In addition, Dr. Fauci is widely recognized for delineating the precise ways that immunosuppressive agents modulate the human immune response. He developed effective therapies for formerly fatal inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases such as polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener's granulomatosis), and lymphomatoid granulomatosis. A 1985 Stanford University Arthritis Center Survey of the American Rheumatism Association membership ranked Dr. Fauci&#8217;s work on the treatment of polyarteritis nodosa and granulomatosis with polyangiitis among the most important advances in patient management in rheumatology over the previous 20 years.<br/>Dr. Fauci has made seminal contributions to the understanding of how HIV destroys the body's defenses leading to its susceptibility to deadly infections. Further, he has been instrumental in developing treatments that enable people with HIV to live long and active lives. He continues to devote much of his research to the immunopathogenic mechanisms of HIV infection and the scope of the body's immune responses to HIV.<br/>In a 2020 analysis of Google Scholar citations, Dr. Fauci ranked as the 41st most highly cited researcher of all time. According to the Web of Science, Dr. Fauci ranked 7th out of more than 1.8 million authors in the field of immunology by total citation count between 1980 and January 2020.<br/>Dr. Fauci has delivered major lectures all over the world and is the recipient of numerous prestigious awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom (the highest honor given to a civilian by the President of the United States), the National Medal of Science, the George M. Kober Medal of the Association of American Physicians, the Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service, the Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research, the Robert Koch Gold Medal, the Prince Mahidol Award, and the Canada Gairdner Global Health Award.  He also has received 45 honorary doctoral degrees from universities in the United States and abroad.<br/>Dr. Fauci is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, as well as other professional societies including the American College of Physicians, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the Association of American Physicians, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Association of Immunologists, and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

NAS is part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, along with the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM).<br/>As a national academy, new members of the organization are elected annually by current members, based on their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research. Election to the National Academy is one of the highest honors in the scientific field. Members of the National Academy of Sciences serve pro bono as \"advisers to the nation\" on science, engineering, and medicine. The group holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code.<br/>Founded in 1863 as a result of an Act of Congress that was approved by Abraham Lincoln, the NAS is charged with \"providing independent, objective advice to the nation on matters related to science and technology. &#8230; to provide scientific advice to the government 'whenever called upon' by any government department.\"<br/>The Academy receives no compensation from the government for its services.&#91;2&#93;<br/>Contents<br/>1&#9;Overview<br/>2&#9;Facilities<br/>3&#9;History<br/>4&#9;Presidents<br/>5&#9;Awards<br/>6&#9;Joint Declaration on Global Warming<br/>7&#9;See also<br/>8&#9;Notable appointments<br/>9&#9;References<br/>10&#9;Further reading<br/>11&#9;External links<br/>Overview<br/>As of 2016, the National Academy of Sciences includes about 2,350 NAS members and 450 international members.&#91;3&#93; It employed about 1,100 staff in 2005.&#91;4&#93; The current members annually elect new members for life. Up to 84 members who are US citizens are elected every year; up to 21 foreign citizens may be elected as international members annually.&#91;5&#93; Approximately 190 members have won a Nobel Prize.&#91;3&#93; By its own admission in 1989, the addition of women to the Academy \"continues at a dismal trickle\", at which time there were 1,516 male members and 57 female members.&#91;6&#93;<br/>The National Academy of Sciences is a member of the International Council for Science (ICSU). The ICSU Advisory Committee, which is in the Research Council's Office of International Affairs, facilitates the participation of members in international scientific unions and serves as a liaison for U.S. national committees for individual scientific unions. Although there is no formal relationship with state and local academies of science, there often is informal dialogue. The National Academy is governed by a 17-member Council, made up of five officers (president, vice president, home secretary, international secretary, and treasurer) and 12 Councilors, all of whom are elected from among the Academy membership.&#91;7&#93; Agencies of the United States government fund about 85 percent of the Academy's activities. Further funding comes from state governments, private foundations, and industrial organizations.&#91;8&#93;<br/>The Council has the ability ad-hoc to delegate certain tasks to committees. For example, the Committee on Animal Nutrition has produced a series of Nutrient requirements of domestic animals reports since at least 1944, each one being initiated by a different sub-committee of experts in the field for example on dairy cattle.<br/>The National Academy of Sciences meets annually in Washington, D.C., which is documented in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, its scholarly journal. The National Academies Press is the publisher for the National Academies, and makes more than 5,000 publications freely available on its website.&#91;9&#93;<br/>From 2004 to 2017, the National Academy of Sciences administered the Marian Koshland Science Museum to provide public exhibits and programming related to its policy work. The museum's exhibits focused on climate change and infectious disease. In 2017 the museum closed and made way for a new science outreach program called LabX.<br/>Facilities<br/>The National Academies' Beckman Conference Center, Irvine, California<br/>Albert Einstein Memorial outside of the National Academy of Sciences building in Washington, D.C.<br/>The National Academy of Sciences maintains multiple buildings around the United States.<br/>The National Academy of Sciences Building is located at 2101 Constitution Avenue, in northwest Washington, D.C.; it sits on the National Mall, adjacent to the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building and in front of the headquarters of the U.S. State Department. The building has a neoclassical architectural style and was built by architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue. The building was dedicated in 1924&#91;10&#93; and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Goodhue engaged a team of artists and architectural sculptors including Albert Herter, Lee Lawrie, and Hildreth Meiere to design interior embellishments celebrating the history and significance of science.&#91;11&#93; The building is used for lectures, symposia, exhibitions, and concerts, in addition to annual meetings of the NAS, NAE, and NAM. The 2012 Presidential Award for Math and Science Teaching ceremony was held here on March 5, 2014. Approximately 150 staff members work at the NAS Building. In June 2012, it reopened to visitors after a major two-year restoration project which restored and improved the building's historic spaces, increased accessibility, and brought the building's aging infrastructure and facilities up to date.&#91;12&#93;<br/>More than 1,000 National Academies staff members work at The Keck Center of the National Academies at 500 Fifth Street in northwest Washington, D.C. The Keck Center provides meeting space and houses the National Academies Press Bookstore.&#91;13&#93; The Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National Academy of Sciences &#8211; formerly located at 525 E St., N.W. &#8211; hosted visits from the public, school field trips, traveling exhibits, and permanent science exhibits.&#91;14&#93;<br/>The NAS also maintains conference centers in California and Massachusetts.&#91;13&#93; The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center is located on 100 Academy Drive in Irvine, California, near the campus of the University of California, Irvine; it offers a conference center and houses several NAS programs. The J. Erik Jonsson Conference Center located at 314 Quissett Avenue in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, is another conference facility.<br/>History<br/>The Act of Incorporation, signed by President Abraham Lincoln on March 3, 1863, created the National Academy of Sciences and named 50 charter members. Many of the original NAS members came from the so-called \"Scientific Lazzaroni,\" an informal network of mostly physical scientists working in the vicinity of Cambridge, Massachusetts (c. 1850).&#91;15&#93;<br/>The Keck Center of the National Academies in Washington, D.C., one of several facilities where the National Academy of Sciences maintains offices<br/>In 1863, enlisting the support of Alexander Dallas Bache and Charles Henry Davis, a professional astronomer who had been recently recalled from the Navy to Washington to head the Bureau of Navigation. They also elicited support from Swiss-American geologist Louis Agassiz and American mathematician Peirce, who together planned the steps whereby the National Academy of Sciences was to be established. Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts was to name Agassiz to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.&#91;16&#93;<br/>Agassiz was to come to Washington at the government's expense to plan the organization with the others. This bypassed Joseph Henry, who was reluctant to have a bill for such an academy presented to Congress. This was in the belief that such a resolution would be \"opposed as something at variance with our democratic institutions\". Nevertheless, Henry soon became the second President of NAS. Agassiz, Davis, Peirce, Benjamin Gould, and Senator Wilson met at Bache's house and \"hurriedly wrote the bill incorporating the Academy, including in it the name of fifty incorporators\".&#91;17&#93;<br/>During the last hours of the session, when the Senate was immersed in the rush of last minute business before its adjournment, Senator Wilson introduced the bill. Without examining it or debating its provisions, both the Senate and House approved it, and President Lincoln signed it.&#91;17&#93;<br/>Although hailed as a great step forward in government recognition of the role of science in American society, at the time, the National Academy of Sciences created enormous ill-feelings among scientists,&#91;17&#93; whether or not they were named as incorporators.<br/>The Act states:<br/>&#91;T&#93;he Academy shall, whenever called upon by any department of the Government, investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art, the actual expense of such investigations, examinations, experiments, and reports to be paid from appropriations which may be made for the purpose, but the Academy shall receive no compensation whatever for any services to the Government of the United States.&#91;18&#93;<br/>The National Academies did not solve the problems facing a nation in Civil War as the Lazzaroni had hoped, nor did it centralize American scientific efforts.&#91;17&#93; However, election to the National Academy did come to be considered \"the pinnacle of scientific achievement for Americans\" until the establishment of the Nobel Prize at the end of the 19th Century.&#91;19&#93;:30<br/>In 1870, the congressional charter was amended to remove the limitation on the number of members.&#91;20&#93;<br/>In 2013, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson was asked to write a speech for the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address in which he made the point that one of Lincoln's greatest legacies was establishing the National Academy of Sciences in that same year, which had the long-term effect of \"setting our Nation on a course of scientifically enlightened governance, without which we all may perish from this Earth\".&#91;21&#93;<br/>Presidents<br/>The president is the head of the Academy, elected by a majority vote of the membership to serve in this position for a term to be determined by the governing Council, not to exceed six years, and may be re-elected for a second term. The Academy has had 22 presidents since its foundation. The current president is geophysicist Marcia K. McNutt, the first woman to hold this position.

The statement stresses that the scientific understanding of climate change had become sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action.&#91;24&#93;<br/>On May 7, 2010, a letter signed by 255 Academy members was published in Science magazine, decrying \"political assaults\" against climate change scientists.&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93; This was in response to a civil investigative demand on the University of Virginia (UVA) by Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, seeking a broad range of documents from Michael E. Mann, a former UVA professor from 1999-2005.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93; Mann, who currently works at Penn State, is a climate change researcher, and Cuccinelli alleges that Mann may have defrauded Virginia taxpayers in the course of his environmental research.

The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, animal foods & feed&#91;4&#93; and veterinary products.<br/>The FDA's primary focus is enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), but the agency also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, as well as associated regulations. Much of this regulatory-enforcement work is not directly related to food or drugs, but involves such things as regulating lasers, cellular phones, and condoms, as well as control of disease in contexts varying from household pets to human sperm donated for use in assisted reproduction.<br/>The FDA is led by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Commissioner reports to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Janet Woodcock is the acting commissioner, as of 20 January 2021.&#91;5&#93;<br/>The FDA has its headquarters in unincorporated White Oak, Maryland.&#91;6&#93; The agency also has 223 field offices and 13 laboratories located throughout the 50 states, the United States Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.&#91;7&#93; In 2008, the FDA began to post employees to foreign countries, including China, India, Costa Rica, Chile, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.&#91;8&#93;<br/>FDA Building 31 houses the Office of the Commissioner and the Office of Regulatory Department of Health and Human Services.&#91;9&#93; The agency consists of fourteen Centers and Offices:&#91;note 1&#93;<br/>Contents<br/>1&#9;Organizational structure<br/>2&#9;Location<br/>2.1&#9;Headquarters<br/>2.2&#9;White Oak Federal Research Center<br/>2.3&#9;Field locations<br/>2.3.1&#9;Office of Regulatory Affairs<br/>2.3.2&#9;Office of Criminal Investigations<br/>2.3.3&#9;Other locations<br/>3&#9;Scope and funding<br/>4&#9;Regulatory programs<br/>4.1&#9;Emergency approvals (EUA)<br/>4.2&#9;Regulations<br/>4.3&#9;Food and dietary supplements<br/>4.3.1&#9;\"FDA-Approved\" vs. \"FDA-Accepted in Food Processing\"<br/>4.4&#9;Medical countermeasures (MCMs)<br/>4.5&#9;Medications<br/>4.5.1&#9;New medications<br/>4.5.1.1&#9;Advertising and promotion<br/>4.5.1.2&#9;Post-market safety surveillance<br/>4.5.2&#9;Generic drugs<br/>4.5.2.1&#9;Generic drug scandal<br/>4.5.3&#9;Over-the-counter drugs<br/>4.5.4&#9;Ebola treatment<br/>4.5.5&#9;Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing<br/>4.6&#9;Vaccines, blood and tissue products, and biotechnology<br/>4.7&#9;Medical and radiation-emitting devices<br/>4.7.1&#9;\"FDA-Cleared\" vs \"FDA-Approved\"<br/>4.8&#9;Cosmetics<br/>4.9&#9;Veterinary products<br/>4.10&#9;Tobacco products<br/>4.11&#9;Regulation of living organisms<br/>4.12&#9;International Cooperation<br/>5&#9;Science and research programs<br/>6&#9;Data management<br/>7&#9;History<br/>7.1&#9;Historical first: FDA and Endo Pharmaceutical's Opana ER (2017)<br/>8&#9;21st century reforms<br/>8.1&#9;Critical Path Initiative<br/>8.2&#9;Patients' rights to access unapproved drugs<br/>8.3&#9;Post-marketing drug safety monitoring<br/>8.4&#9;Pediatric drug testing<br/>8.5&#9;Priority review voucher (PRV)<br/>8.6&#9;Rules for generic biologics<br/>8.7&#9;Mobile medical applications<br/>9&#9;Criticisms<br/>10&#9;See also<br/>11&#9;Notes<br/>12&#9;References<br/>13&#9;Further reading<br/>14&#9;External links<br/>Organizational structure<br/>Taha Kass-Hout (2014)<br/>Department of Health and Human Services<br/>Food and Drug Administration<br/>Office of the Commissioner<br/>Office of Operations&#91;10&#93;<br/>Office of Equal Employment Opportunity<br/>Office of Human Resources<br/>Office of Finance, Budget and Acquisition<br/>Office of Information Management and Technology<br/>Office of Informatics & Technology Innovation<br/>Director: Taha A.

The first building, the Life Sciences Laboratory, was dedicated and opened with 104 employees in December 2003. As of December 2018, the FDA campus has a population of 10,987 employees housed in approximately 3,800,000 square feet (350,000 square metres) of space, divided into ten office and four laboratory buildings. The campus houses the Office of the Commissioner (OC), the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA),  the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and offices for the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM).&#91;6&#93;<br/>With the passing of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA is projecting a 64% increase in employees to 18,000 over the next 15 years, and would like to add approximately 1,600,000 square feet (150,000 square metres) of office and special use space to their existing facilities. The National Capital Planning Commission approved a new master plan for this expansion in December 2018,&#91;15&#93; and construction is expected to be completed by 2035, dependent on GSA appropriations.&#91;16&#93;<br/>Field locations<br/>The Arkansas Laboratory in Jefferson, Arkansas is the headquarters of the National Center for Toxicological Research<br/>Office of Regulatory Affairs<br/>The Office of Regulatory Affairs is considered the agency's \"eyes and ears,\" conducting the vast majority of the FDA's work in the field. Its employees, known as Consumer Safety Officers, or more commonly known simply as investigators, inspect production and warehousing facilities, investigate complaints, illnesses, or outbreaks, and review documentation in the case of medical devices, drugs, biological products, and other items where it may be difficult to conduct a physical examination or take a physical sample of the product. The Office of Regulatory Affairs is divided into five regions, which are further divided into 20 districts. Districts are based roughly on the geographic divisions of the Federal court system. Each district comprises a main district office and a number of Resident Posts, which are FDA remote offices that serve a particular geographic area. ORA also includes the Agency's network of regulatory laboratories, which analyze any physical samples taken. Though samples are usually food-related, some laboratories are equipped to analyze drugs, cosmetics, and radiation-emitting devices.<br/>Office of Criminal Investigations<br/>Jamaica, Queens, NY Regional Office - USFDA<br/>The Office of Criminal Investigations was established in 1991 to investigate criminal cases. To do so, OCI employs approximately 200 Special Agents nationwide who, unlike ORA Investigators, are armed, have badges, and do not focus on technical aspects of the regulated industries. Rather, OCI agents pursue and develop cases when individuals and companies commit criminal actions, such as fraudulent claims or knowingly and willfully shipping known adulterated goods in interstate commerce. In many cases, OCI pursues cases involving violations of Title 18 of the United States Code (e.g., conspiracy, false statements, wire fraud, mail fraud), in addition to prohibited acts as defined in Chapter III of the FD&C Act. OCI Special Agents often come from other criminal investigations backgrounds, and frequently work closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Assistant Attorney General, and even Interpol. OCI receives cases from a variety of sources&#8212;including ORA, local agencies, and the FBI, and works with ORA Investigators to help develop the technical and science-based aspects of a case.<br/>Other locations<br/>The FDA has a number of field offices across the United States, in addition to international locations in China, India, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.&#91;17&#93;<br/>Scope and funding<br/>The FDA regulates more than US$2.4 trillion worth of consumer goods, about 25% of consumer expenditures in the United States. This includes $466 billion in food sales, $275 billion in drugs, $60 billion in cosmetics and $18 billion in vitamin supplements. Much of these expenditures are for goods imported into the United States; the FDA is responsible for monitoring imports.&#91;18&#93;<br/>The FDA's federal budget request for fiscal year (FY) 2012 totaled $4.36 billion,&#91;7&#93; while the proposed 2014 budget is $4.7 billion.&#91;19&#93; About $2 billion of this budget is generated by user fees. Pharmaceutical firms pay the majority of these fees,&#91;19&#93; which are used to expedite drug reviews.&#91;20&#93; The FDA's federal budget request for fiscal year (FY) 2008 (October 2007 through September 2008) totaled $2.1 billion, a $105.8 million increase from what it received for fiscal year 2007.&#91;21&#93;<br/>In February 2008, the FDA announced that the Bush Administration's FY 2009 budget request for the agency was just under $2.4 billion: $1.77 billion in budget authority (federal funding) and $628 million in user fees. The requested budget authority was an increase of $50.7 million more than the FY 2008 funding &#8211; about a three percent increase. In June 2008, Congress gave the agency an emergency appropriation of $150 million for FY 2008 and another $150 million.&#91;18&#93;<br/>Regulatory programs<br/>Emergency approvals (EUA)<br/>Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism that was created to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.<br/>Regulations<br/>The programs for safety regulation vary widely by the type of product, its potential risks, and the regulatory powers granted to the agency. For example, the FDA regulates almost every facet of prescription drugs, including testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, efficacy, and safety&#8212;yet FDA regulation of cosmetics focuses primarily on labeling and safety. The FDA regulates most products with a set of published standards enforced by a modest number of facility inspections. Inspection observations are documented on Form 483.<br/>In June 2018, the FDA released a statement regarding new guidelines to help food and drug manufacturers \"implement protections against potential attacks on the U.S. food supply\".&#91;22&#93; One of the new guidelines includes the Intentional Adulteration (IA) rule, which requires strategies and procedures by the food industry to reduce the risk of compromise in facilities and processes that are significantly vulnerable.<br/>The FDA also uses tactics of regulatory shaming,&#91;23&#93; mainly through online publication of non-compliance, warning letters, and \"shaming lists.\" Regulation by shaming harnesses firms' sensitivity to reputational damage. For example, in 2018, the agency published an online \"black list,\" in which it named dozens of branded drug companies that are supposedly using unlawful or unethical means to attempt to impede competition from generic drug companies.&#91;24&#93;<br/>The FDA frequently works with other federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs and Border Protection, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. They also often work with local and state government agencies in performing regulatory inspections and enforcement actions.<br/>Food and dietary supplements<br/>This section does not cite any sources.

Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and accompanying legislation, the FDA has authority to oversee the quality of substances sold as food in the United States, and to monitor claims made in the labeling of both the composition and the health benefits of foods.<br/>The FDA subdivides substances that it regulates as food into various categories&#8212;including foods, food additives, added substances (man-made substances that are not intentionally introduced into food, but nevertheless end up in it), and dietary supplements. Dietary supplements or dietary ingredients include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and. enzymes.&#91;25&#93; Specific standards the FDA exercises differ from one category to the next. Furthermore, legislation had granted the FDA a variety of means to address violations of standards for a given substance category.<br/>Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), the FDA is responsible for ensuring that manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients meet the current requirements. These manufacturers and distributors are not allowed to advertise their products in an adulterated way, and they are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their product.&#91;26&#93;<br/>The FDA has a &#8220;Dietary Supplement Ingredient Advisory List&#8221; that includes ingredients that sometimes appear on dietary supplements but need further evaluation further.&#91;27&#93; An ingredient is added to this list when it is excluded from use in a dietary supplement, does not appear to be an approved food additive or recognized as safe, and/or is subjected to the requirement for pre-market notification without having a satisfied requirement.&#91;28&#93;<br/>\"FDA-Approved\" vs. \"FDA-Accepted in Food Processing\"<br/>The FDA does not approve applied coatings used in the food processing industry.&#91;29&#93; There is no review process to approve the composition of nonstick coatings; nor does the FDA inspect or test these materials. Through their governing of processes, however, the FDA does have a set of regulations that cover the formulation, manufacturing, and use of nonstick coatings. Hence, materials like Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) are not, and cannot be, considered as FDA Approved, rather, they are \"FDA Compliant\" or \"FDA Acceptable\".<br/>Medical countermeasures (MCMs)<br/>Further information: Biosecurity, Bioterrorism, and Biosecurity in the United States<br/>Medical countermeasures (MCMs) are products such as biologics and pharmaceutical drugs that can protect from or treat the health effects of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) attack. MCMs can also be used for prevention and diagnosis of symptoms associated with CBRN attacks or threats.&#91;30&#93; The FDA runs a program called the \"FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative\" (MCMi), with programs funded by the federal government. It helps support \"partner\" agencies and organisations prepare for public health emergencies that could require MCMs.&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93;<br/>Medications<br/>This section does not cite any sources.

The most rigorous requirements apply to new molecular entities: drugs that are not based on existing medications.<br/>New medications<br/>This section needs additional citations for verification.

A change to over-the-counter (OTC) status is a separate process, and the drug must be approved through an NDA first. A drug that is approved is said to be \"safe and effective when used as directed\".<br/>Very rare limited exceptions to this multi-step process involving animal testing and controlled clinical trials can be granted out of compassionate use protocols. This was the case during the 2015 Ebola epidemic with the use, by prescription and authorization, of ZMapp and other experimental treatments, and for new drugs that can be used to treat debilitating and/or very rare conditions for which no existing remedies or drugs are satisfactory, or where there has not been an advance in a long period of time. The studies are progressively longer, gradually adding more individuals as they progress from stage I to stage III, normally over a period of years, and normally involve drug companies, the government and its laboratories, and often medical schools and hospitals and clinics. However, any exceptions to the aforementioned process are subject to strict review and scrutiny and conditions, and are only given if a substantial amount of research and at least some preliminary human testing has shown that they are believed to be somewhat safe and possibly effective.<br/>Advertising and promotion<br/>This section needs additional citations for verification.

(August 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)<br/>The FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion reviews and regulates prescription drug advertising and promotion through surveillance activities and issuance of enforcement letters to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Advertising and promotion for over-the-counter drugs is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. The FDA also empowers third-party enforcer-firms to engage in some regulatory oversight, e.g. the FDA expects pharmaceutical companies to make sure that third-party suppliers and labs abide by the agency's health and safety guidelines.&#91;35&#93;:4<br/>The drug advertising regulation&#91;36&#93; contains two broad requirements: (1) a company may advertise or promote a drug only for the specific indication or medical use for which it was approved by FDA. Also, an advertisement must contain a \"fair balance\" between the benefits and the risks (side effects) of a drug.<br/>The term off-label refers to drug usage for indications other than those approved by the FDA.<br/>Post-market safety surveillance<br/>After NDA approval, the sponsor must then review and report to the FDA every single patient adverse drug experience it learns of. They must report unexpected serious and fatal adverse drug events within 15 days, and other events on a quarterly basis.&#91;37&#93; The FDA also receives directly adverse drug event reports through its MedWatch program.&#91;38&#93; These reports are called \"spontaneous reports\" because reporting by consumers and health professionals is voluntary.<br/>While this remains the primary tool of post-market safety surveillance, FDA requirements for post-marketing risk management are increasing. As a condition of approval, a sponsor may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, called Phase IV trials. In some cases, the FDA requires risk management plans called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for some drugs that require actions to be taken to ensure that the drug is used safely.&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93; For example, thalidomide can cause birth defects, but has uses that outweigh the risks if men and women taking the drugs do not conceive a child; a REMS program for thalidomide mandates an auditable process to ensure that people taking the drug take action to avoid pregnancy; many opioid drugs have REMS programs to avoid addiction and diversion of drugs.&#91;39&#93; The drug isotretinoin has a REMS program called iPLEDGE.&#91;41&#93;<br/>Generic drugs<br/>Generic drugs are chemical and therapeutic equivalents of name-brand drugs whose patents have expired.&#91;42&#93; Approved generic drugs should have the same dosage, safety, effectiveness, strength, stability, and quality, as well as route of administration. In general, they are less expensive than their name brand counterparts, are manufactured and marketed by rival companies and, in the 1990s, accounted for about a third of all prescriptions written in the United States.&#91;42&#93; For a pharmaceutical company to gain approval to produce a generic drug, the FDA requires scientific evidence that the generic drug is interchangeable with or therapeutically equivalent to the originally approved drug.&#91;43&#93; This is called an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA).&#91;44&#93; As of 2012, 80% of all FDA approved drugs are available in generic form.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>Generic drug scandal<br/>In 1989, a major scandal erupted involving the procedures used by the FDA to approve generic drugs for sale to the public.&#91;42&#93; Charges of corruption in generic drug approval first emerged in 1988 during the course of an extensive congressional investigation into the FDA. The oversight subcommittee of the United States House Energy and Commerce Committee resulted from a complaint brought against the FDA by Mylan Laboratories Inc. of Pittsburgh. When its application to manufacture generics were subjected to repeated delays by the FDA, Mylan, convinced that it was being discriminated against, soon began its own private investigation of the agency in 1987. Mylan eventually filed suit against two former FDA employees and four drug-manufacturing companies, charging that corruption within the federal agency resulted in racketeering and in violations of antitrust law. \"The order in which new generic drugs were approved was set by the FDA employees even before drug manufacturers submitted applications\" and, according to Mylan, this illegal procedure was followed to give preferential treatment to certain companies. During the summer of 1989, three FDA officials (Charles Y. Chang, David J. Brancato, Walter Kletch) pleaded guilty to criminal charges of accepting bribes from generic drugs makers, and two companies (Par Pharmaceutical and its subsidiary Quad Pharmaceuticals)&#91;45&#93; pleaded guilty to giving bribes.<br/>Furthermore, it was discovered that several manufacturers had falsified data submitted in seeking FDA authorization to market certain generic drugs. Vitarine Pharmaceuticals of New York, which sought approval of a generic version of the drug Dyazide, a medication for high blood pressure, submitted Dyazide, rather than its generic version, for the FDA tests. In April 1989, the FDA investigated 11 manufacturers for irregularities; and later brought that number up to 13. Dozens of drugs were eventually suspended or recalled by manufacturers. In the early 1990s, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud charges against the Bolar Pharmaceutical Company, a major generic manufacturer based in Long Island, New York.&#91;42&#93;<br/>Over-the-counter drugs<br/>Over-the-counter (OTC) are drugs like aspirin that do not require a doctor's prescription.&#91;46&#93; The FDA has a list of approximately 800 such approved ingredients that are combined in various ways to create more than 100,000 OTC drug products. Many OTC drug ingredients had been previously approved prescription drugs now deemed safe enough for use without a medical practitioner's supervision like ibuprofen.&#91;47&#93;<br/>Ebola treatment<br/>In 2014, the FDA added an Ebola treatment being developed by Canadian pharmaceutical company Tekmira to the Fast Track program, but halted the phase 1 trials in July pending the receipt of more information about how the drug works. This was widely viewed as increasingly important in the face of a major outbreak of the disease in West Africa that began in late March 2014 and ended in June 2016.&#91;48&#93;<br/>Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing<br/>Main article: COVID-19 testing<br/>During the coronavirus pandemic, FDA granted emergency use authorization for personal protective equipment (PPE), in vitro diagnostic equipment, ventilators and other medical devices.&#91;49&#93;&#91;50&#93;<br/>On March 18, FDA inspectors postponed most foreign facility inspections and all domestic routine surveillance facility inspections.&#91;51&#93; In contrast, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) continued inspections of meatpacking plants, which resulted in 145 FSIS field employees who tested positive for COVID-19, and three who died.&#91;52&#93;<br/>Vaccines, blood and tissue products, and biotechnology<br/>This section needs additional citations for verification.

Cosmetic products are not, in general, subject to premarket approval by the FDA unless they make \"structure or function claims\" that make them into drugs (see Cosmeceutical). However, all color additives must be specifically FDA approved before manufacturers can include them in cosmetic products sold in the U.S. The FDA regulates cosmetics labeling, and cosmetics that have not been safety tested must bear a warning to that effect.&#91;56&#93;<br/>According to the industry advocacy group the American Council on Science and Health, though the cosmetic industry is predominantly responsible in ensuring the safety of its products, the FDA also has the power to intervene when necessary to protect the public but in general does not require pre-market approval or testing. The ACSH says that companies are required to place a warning note on their products if they have not been tested and that experts in cosmetic ingredient reviews also play a role in monitoring safety through influence on the use of ingredients, but also lack legal authority. According to the ACSH, overall the organization has reviewed about 1,200 ingredients and has suggested that several hundred be restricted, but there is no standard or systemic method for reviewing chemicals for safety and a clear definition of what is meant by 'safety' so that all chemicals are tested on the same basis.&#91;57&#93;<br/>Veterinary products<br/>The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is a center of the FDA that regulates food additives and drugs that are given to animals.&#91;58&#93; CVM regulates animal drugs, animal food including pet animal, and animal medical devices.

Reynolds, Lorillard, Commonwealth Brands, Liggett Group and Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company have filed suit in Washington, D.C. federal court claiming that the graphic labels are an unconstitutional way of forcing tobacco companies to engage in anti-smoking advocacy on the government's behalf.&#91;64&#93;<br/>A First Amendment lawyer, Floyd Abrams, is representing the tobacco companies in the case, contending requiring graphic warning labels on a lawful product cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.&#91;65&#93; The Association of National Advertisers and the American Advertising Federation have also filed a brief in the suit, arguing that the labels infringe on commercial free speech and could lead to further government intrusion if left unchallenged.&#91;66&#93; In November 2011, Federal judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia temporarily halted the new labels, likely delaying the requirement that tobacco companies display the labels.

The OpenFDA project was created to enable easy access of the data for the public and was officially launched in June 2014.&#91;77&#93;&#91;78&#93;<br/>History<br/>Main article: History of the Food and Drug Administration<br/>Up until the 20th century, there were few federal laws regulating the contents and sale of domestically produced food and pharmaceuticals, with one exception being the short-lived Vaccine Act of 1813. The history of the FDA can be traced to the latter part of the 19th century and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Division of Chemistry, later its Bureau of Chemistry. Under Harvey Washington Wiley, appointed chief chemist in 1883, the Division began conducting research into the adulteration and misbranding of food and drugs on the American market. Wiley's advocacy came at a time when the public had become aroused to hazards in the marketplace by muckraking journalists like Upton Sinclair, and became part of a general trend for increased federal regulations in matters pertinent to public safety during the Progressive Era.&#91;79&#93; The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was put in place after a diphtheria antitoxin&#8212;derived from tetanus-contaminated serum&#8212;was used to produce a vaccine that caused the deaths of thirteen children in St. Louis, Missouri. The serum was originally collected from a horse name Jim who had contracted tetanus.<br/>Harvey W. Wiley, chief advocate of the Food and Drug Act<br/>In June 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt signed into law the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, also known as the \"Wiley Act\" after its chief advocate.&#91;79&#93; The Act prohibited, under penalty of seizure of goods, the interstate transport of food that had been \"adulterated\". The Act applied similar penalties to the interstate marketing of \"adulterated\" drugs, in which the \"standard of strength, quality, or purity\" of the active ingredient was not either stated clearly on the label or listed in the United States Pharmacopeia or the National Formulary.&#91;80&#93;<br/>The responsibility for examining food and drugs for such \"adulteration\" or \"misbranding\" was given to Wiley's USDA Bureau of Chemistry.&#91;79&#93; Wiley used these new regulatory powers to pursue an aggressive campaign against the manufacturers of foods with chemical additives, but the Chemistry Bureau's authority was soon checked by judicial decisions, which narrowly defined the bureau's powers and set high standards for proof of fraudulent intent.&#91;79&#93; In 1927, the Bureau of Chemistry's regulatory powers were reorganized under a new USDA body, the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration.&#91;81&#93; This name was shortened to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) three years later.&#91;82&#93;<br/>By the 1930s, muckraking journalists, consumer protection organizations, and federal regulators began mounting a campaign for stronger regulatory authority by publicizing a list of injurious products that had been ruled permissible under the 1906 law, including radioactive beverages, the mascara Lash lure which caused blindness, and worthless \"cures\" for diabetes and tuberculosis. The resulting proposed law was unable to get through the Congress of the United States for five years, but was rapidly enacted into law following the public outcry over the 1937 Elixir Sulfanilamide tragedy, in which over 100 people died after using a drug formulated with a toxic, untested solvent.&#91;83&#93;<br/>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act into law on June 24, 1938. The new law significantly increased federal regulatory authority over drugs by mandating a pre-market review of the safety of all new drugs, as well as banning false therapeutic claims in drug labeling without requiring that the FDA prove fraudulent intent. Soon after passage of the 1938 Act, the FDA began to designate certain drugs as safe for use only under the supervision of a medical professional, and the category of \"prescription-only\" drugs was securely codified into law by the Durham-Humphrey Amendment in 1951. These developments confirmed extensive powers for the FDA to enforce post-marketing recalls of ineffective drugs.&#91;79&#93;<br/>Medical Officer Alexander Fleming, M. D., examines a portion of a 240-volume new drug application around the late 1980s. Applications grew considerably after the efficacy mandate under the 1962 Drug Amendments.<br/>Outside of the US, the drug thalidomide was marketed for the relief of general nausea and morning sickness, but caused birth defects and even the death of thousands of babies when taken during pregnancy.&#91;84&#93; American mothers were largely unaffected as Dr. Frances Oldham Kelsey of the FDA refused to authorize the medication for market. In 1962, the Kefauver-Harris Amendment to the FD&C Act was passed, which represented a \"revolution\" in FDA regulatory authority.&#91;85&#93; The most important change was the requirement that all new drug applications demonstrate \"substantial evidence\" of the drug's efficacy for a marketed indication, in addition to the existing requirement for pre-marketing demonstration of safety. This marked the start of the FDA approval process in its modern form.<br/>These reforms had the effect of increasing the time, and the difficulty, required to bring a drug to market.&#91;86&#93; One of the most important statutes in establishing the modern American pharmaceutical market was the 1984 Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, more commonly known as the \"Hatch-Waxman Act\" after its chief sponsors. The act extended the patent exclusivity terms of new drugs, and tied those extensions, in part, to the length of the FDA approval process for each individual drug. For generic manufacturers, the Act created a new approval mechanism, the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), in which the generic drug manufacturer need only demonstrate that their generic formulation has the same active ingredient, route of administration, dosage form, strength, and pharmacokinetic properties (\"bioequivalence\") as the corresponding brand-name drug. This Act has been credited with, in essence, creating the modern generic drug industry.&#91;87&#93;<br/>Concerns about the length of the drug approval process were brought to the fore early in the AIDS epidemic. In the mid- and late 1980s, ACT-UP and other HIV activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections.&#91;88&#93; Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA issued new rules to expedite approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases, and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options.&#91;89&#93; All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through these accelerated approval mechanisms.&#91;90&#93; Frank Young, then commissioner of the FDA, was behind the Action Plan Phase II, established in August 1987 for quicker approval of AIDS medication.&#91;91&#93;<br/>In two instances, state governments have sought to legalize drugs that the FDA has not approved. Under the theory that federal law, passed pursuant to Constitutional authority, overrules conflicting state laws, federal authorities still claim the authority to seize, arrest, and prosecute for possession and sales of these substances,&#91;citation needed&#93; even in states where they are legal under state law. The first wave was the legalization by 27 states of laetrile in the late 1970s. This drug was used as a treatment for cancer, but scientific studies both before and after this legislative trend found it to be ineffective.&#91;92&#93;&#91;93&#93; The second wave concerned medical marijuana in the 1990s and 2000s. Though Virginia passed legislation allowing doctors to recommend cannabis for glaucoma or the side effects of chemotherapy, a more widespread trend began in California with the Compassionate Use Act of 1996.<br/>Historical first: FDA and Endo Pharmaceutical's Opana ER (2017)<br/>When the FDA requested Endo Pharmaceuticals on June 8, 2017, to remove oxymorphone hydrochloride from the market, it was the first such request in FDA history.&#91;94&#93;<br/>21st century reforms<br/>Critical Path Initiative<br/>The Critical Path Initiative&#91;95&#93; is the FDA's effort to stimulate and facilitate a national effort to modernize the sciences through which FDA-regulated products are developed, evaluated, and manufactured. The Initiative was launched in March 2004, with the release of a report entitled Innovation/Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products.&#91;96&#93;<br/>Patients' rights to access unapproved drugs<br/>The Compassionate Investigational New Drug program was created after Randall v. U.S. ruled in favor of Robert C. Randall in 1978, creating a program for medical marijuana.&#91;97&#93;<br/>A 2006 court case, Abigail Alliance v. von Eschenbach, would have forced radical changes in FDA regulation of unapproved drugs. The Abigail Alliance argued that the FDA must license drugs for use by terminally ill patients with \"desperate diagnoses,\" after they have completed Phase I testing.&#91;98&#93; The case won an initial appeal in May 2006, but that decision was reversed by a March 2007 rehearing. The US Supreme Court declined to hear the case, and the final decision denied the existence of a right to unapproved medications.<br/>Critics of the FDA's regulatory power argue that the FDA takes too long to approve drugs that might ease pain and human suffering faster if brought to market sooner. The AIDS crisis created some political efforts to streamline the approval process. However, these limited reforms were targeted for AIDS drugs, not for the broader market. This has led to the call for more robust and enduring reforms that would allow patients, under the care of their doctors, access to drugs that have passed the first round of clinical trials.&#91;99&#93;&#91;100&#93;<br/>Post-marketing drug safety monitoring<br/>The widely publicized recall of Vioxx, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) now estimated to have contributed to fatal heart attacks in thousands of Americans, played a strong role in driving a new wave of safety reforms at both the FDA rulemaking and statutory levels. Vioxx was approved by the FDA in 1999 and was initially hoped to be safer than previous NSAIDs, due to its reduced risk of intestinal tract bleeding. However, a number of pre- and post-marketing studies suggested that Vioxx might increase the risk of myocardial infarction, and this was conclusively demonstrated by results from the APPROVe trial in 2004.&#91;101&#93;<br/>Faced with numerous lawsuits, the manufacturer voluntarily withdrew it from the market. The example of Vioxx has been prominent in an ongoing debate over whether new drugs should be evaluated on the basis of their absolute safety, or their safety relative to existing treatments for a given condition. In the wake of the Vioxx recall, there were widespread calls by major newspapers, medical journals, consumer advocacy organizations, lawmakers, and FDA officials&#91;102&#93; for reforms in the FDA's procedures for pre- and post-market drug safety regulation.<br/>In 2006, a Congressional committee was appointed by the Institute of Medicine to review pharmaceutical safety regulation in the U.S. and to issue recommendations for improvements. The committee was composed of 16 experts, including leaders in clinical medicine medical research, economics, biostatistics, law, public policy, public health, and the allied health professions, as well as current and former executives from the pharmaceutical, hospital, and health insurance industries. The authors found major deficiencies in the current FDA system for ensuring the safety of drugs on the American market. Overall, the authors called for an increase in the regulatory powers, funding, and independence of the FDA.&#91;103&#93;&#91;104&#93; Some of the committee's recommendations were incorporated into drafts of the PDUFA IV amendment, which was signed into law as the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007.&#91;105&#93;<br/>As of 2011, Risk Minimization Action Plans (RiskMAPS) have been created to ensure risks of a drug never outweigh the benefits of that drug within the post-marketing period. This program requires that manufacturers design and implement periodic assessments of their programs' effectiveness. The Risk Minimization Action Plans are set in place depending on the overall level of risk a prescription drug is likely to pose to the public.&#91;106&#93;<br/>Pediatric drug testing<br/>Prior to the 1990s, only 20% of all drugs prescribed for children in the United States were tested for safety or efficacy in a pediatric population.&#91;citation needed&#93; This became a major concern of pediatricians as evidence accumulated that the physiological response of children to many drugs differed significantly from those drugs' effects on adults. Children react differently to the drugs because of many reasons, including size, weight, etc. There were several reasons that few medical trials were done with children. For many drugs, children represented such a small proportion of the potential market, that drug manufacturers did not see such testing as cost-effective.&#91;107&#93;<br/>Also, because children were thought to be ethically restricted in their ability to give informed consent, there were increased governmental and institutional hurdles to approval of these clinical trials, as well as greater concerns about legal liability. Thus, for decades, most medicines prescribed to children in the U.S. were done so in a non-FDA-approved, \"off-label\" manner, with dosages \"extrapolated\" from adult data through body weight and body-surface-area calculations.&#91;107&#93;<br/>An initial attempt by the FDA to address this issue was the 1994 FDA Final Rule on Pediatric Labeling and Extrapolation, which allowed manufacturers to add pediatric labeling information, but required drugs that had not been tested for pediatric safety and efficacy to bear a disclaimer to that effect. However, this rule failed to motivate many drug companies to conduct additional pediatric drug trials. In 1997, the FDA proposed a rule to require pediatric drug trials from the sponsors of New Drug Applications. However, this new rule was successfully preempted in federal court as exceeding the FDA's statutory authority.&#91;107&#93;<br/>While this debate was unfolding, Congress used the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 to pass incentives that gave pharmaceutical manufacturers a six-month patent term extension on new drugs submitted with pediatric trial data. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2007 reauthorized these provisions and allowed the FDA to request NIH-sponsored testing for pediatric drug testing, although these requests are subject to NIH funding constraints. In the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, Congress codified the FDA's authority to mandate manufacturer-sponsored pediatric drug trials for certain drugs as a \"last resort\" if incentives and publicly funded mechanisms proved inadequate.&#91;107&#93;<br/>Priority review voucher (PRV)<br/>The priority review voucher is a provision of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, which awards a transferable \"priority review voucher\" to any company that obtains approval for a treatment for a neglected tropical diseases. The system was first proposed by Duke University faculty David Ridley, Henry Grabowski, and Jeffrey Moe in their 2006 Health Affairs paper: \"Developing Drugs for Developing Countries\".&#91;108&#93; President Obama signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 which extended the authorization until 2017.&#91;109&#93;<br/>Rules for generic biologics<br/>Since the 1990s, many successful new drugs for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other conditions have been protein-based biotechnology drugs, regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Many of these drugs are extremely expensive; for example, the anti-cancer drug Avastin costs $55,000 for a year of treatment,&#91;citation needed&#93; while the enzyme replacement therapy drug Cerezyme costs $200,000 per year, and must be taken by Gaucher's Disease patients for life.&#91;110&#93;<br/>Biotechnology drugs do not have the simple, readily verifiable chemical structures of conventional drugs, and are produced through complex, often proprietary, techniques, such as transgenic mammalian cell cultures. Because of these complexities, the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act did not include biologics in the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process. This precluded the possibility of generic drug competition for biotechnology drugs. In February 2007, identical bills were introduced into the House to create an ANDA process for the approval of generic biologics, but were not passed.&#91;110&#93;<br/>Mobile medical applications<br/>In 2013, a guidance was issued to regulate mobile medical applications and protect users from their unintended use. This guidance distinguishes the apps subjected to regulation based on the marketing claims of the apps.&#91;111&#93; Incorporation of the guidelines during the development phase of these apps has been proposed for expedited market entry and clearance.&#91;112&#93;<br/>Criticisms<br/>Main article: Criticism of the Food and Drug Administration<br/>The FDA has regulatory oversight over a large array of products that affect the health and life of American citizens.&#91;79&#93; As a result, the FDA's powers and decisions are carefully monitored by several governmental and non-governmental organizations. A $1.8 million 2006 Institute of Medicine report on pharmaceutical regulation in the U.S. found major deficiencies in the current FDA system for ensuring the safety of drugs on the American market. Overall, the authors called for an increase in the regulatory powers, funding, and independence of the FDA.&#91;113&#93;&#91;114&#93;<br/>Nine FDA scientists appealed to then president-elect Barack Obama over pressures from management, experienced during the George W. Bush presidency, to manipulate data, including in relation to the review process for medical devices. Characterized as \"corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers, thereby placing the American people at risk,\" these concerns were also highlighted in the 2006 report&#91;113&#93; on the agency as well.&#91;115&#93;<br/>The FDA has also been criticized from the opposite viewpoint, as being too tough on industry. According to an analysis published on the website of the libertarian Mercatus Center, many feel the FDA oversteps its regulatory powers, and undermines small business and small farms in favor of large corporations. Three of the FDA restrictions under their analysis are the permitting of new drugs and devices, the control of manufacturer speech, and the imposition of prescription requirements. The authors argue that in the increasingly complex and diverse food marketplace, the FDA is not equipped to adequately regulate or inspect food.&#91;116&#93;&#91;verification needed&#93;<br/>However, in an indicator that the FDA may be too lax in their approval process, in particular for medical devices, a 2011 study by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and Paul Brown of the National Research Center for Women and Families, and Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for \"serious health problems or death\" had been previously approved by the FDA using the less stringent, and cheaper, 510(k) process. In a few cases, the devices had been deemed so low-risk that they did not need FDA regulation. Of the 113 devices recalled, 35 were for cardiovascular health purposes.&#91;117&#93;"},{"id":396,"title":"Health Costs And Financing: Challenges And Strategies For A New Administration","group":"Document","image":"img/document.png","value":1,"notes":"Health Costs And Financing: Challenges And Strategies For A New Administration<br/>William H Shrank 1, Nancy-Ann DeParle 2, Scott Gottlieb 3, Sachin H Jain 4, Peter Orszag 5, Brian W Powers 6, Gail R Wilensky 7<br/>Affiliations collapse<br/>Affiliations<br/>1William H.

There is pressing need and opportunity for health reform that helps achieve better access, affordability, and equity. In this commentary, which is part of the National Academy of Medicine's Vital Directions for Health and Health Care: Priorities for 2021 initiative, we draw on our collective backgrounds in health financing, delivery, and innovation to offer consensus-based policy recommendations focused on health costs and financing. We organize our recommendations around five policy priorities: expanding insurance coverage, accelerating the transition to value-based care, advancing home-based care, improving the affordability of drugs and other therapeutics, and developing a high-value workforce. Within each priority we provide recommendations for key elected officials and political appointees that could be used as starting points for evidence-based policy making that supports a more effective, efficient, and equitable health system in the US.<br/>Similar articles<br/>The cost of free health care for all Kenyans: assessing the financial sustainability of contributory and non-contributory financing mechanisms.<br/>Okungu V, Chuma J, McIntyre D.<br/>Int J Equity Health. 2017 Feb 27;16(1):39. doi: 10.1186/s12939-017-0535-9.<br/>PMID: 28241826 Free PMC article.<br/>Policy levers and priority-setting in universal health coverage: a qualitative analysis of healthcare financing agenda setting in Kenya.<br/>Oraro-Lawrence T, Wyss K.<br/>BMC Health Serv Res. 2020 Mar 6;20(1):182. doi: 10.1186/s12913-020-5041-x.<br/>PMID: 32143629 Free PMC article.<br/>The imperative for systems thinking to promote access to medicines, efficient delivery, and cost-effectiveness when implementing health financing reforms: a qualitative study.<br/>Achoki T, Lesego A.<br/>Int J Equity Health. 2017 Mar 21;16(1):53. doi: 10.1186/s12939-017-0550-x.<br/>PMID: 28327143 Free PMC article.<br/>Tuberculosis.<br/>Bloom BR, Atun R, Cohen T, Dye C, Fraser H, Gomez GB, Knight G, Murray M, Nardell E, Rubin E, Salomon J, Vassall A, Volchenkov G, White R, Wilson D, Yadav P.<br/>In: Holmes KK, Bertozzi S, Bloom BR, Jha P, editors.

NEA's tenth fund had $2.3 billion of investor commitments in 2000. After raising a more modest $1.1 billion in 2004 for the firm's eleventh fund, NEA raised $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion for its next two funds, respectively.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; In 2010, NEA launched its thirteenth investment fund with $2.5 billion of investor capital, the largest since the Financial crisis of 2007&#8211;08.&#91;11&#93; In 2012, NEA closed its fourteenth investment fund with $2.6 billion of investor capital.&#91;2&#93;&#91;5&#93; In April 2015, NEA closed its fifteenth investment fund with $3.1 billion in investor capital - the largest venture capital fund ever raised.&#91;12&#93; In June 2017, NEA closed its sixteenth investment fund with $3.3 billion in investor capital - again the largest venture capital fund ever raised.&#91;13&#93;<br/>In 2018, former CEO of General Electric, Jeff Immelt, joined the firm as a venture partner.&#91;14&#93;<br/>In March 2020, NEA named Liza Landsman as a General Partner.

While working with CW Group, a venture-capital firm, Bock and Stuelpnagel uncovered what would become Illumina's BeadArray technology&#91;3&#93; at Tufts University and negotiated an exclusive license to that technology. In 1999, Illumina acquired Spyder Instruments (founded by Michal Lebl, Richard Houghten, and Jutta Eichler) for their technology of high-throughput synthesis. Illumina completed its initial public offering in July 2000.&#91;4&#93;<br/>Illumina began offering single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping services in 2001 and launched its first system, the Illumina BeadLab, in 2002, using GoldenGate Genotyping technology. Illumina currently offers microarray-based products and services for an expanding range of genetic analysis sequencing, including SNP genotyping, gene expression, and protein analysis. Illumina's technologies are used by a broad range of academic, government, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other leading institutions around the globe.<br/>On January 26, 2007, the company completed the acquisition of the British company Solexa, Inc. for ~$650M.&#91;5&#93; Solexa was founded in June 1998 by Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman to develop and commercialize genome-sequencing technology invented by the founders at the University of Cambridge. Solexa INC was formed in 2005 when Solexa Ltd reversed into Lynx Therapeutics of Hayward.&#91;6&#93; Illumina also uses the DNA colony sequencing technology, invented in 1997 by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli &#91;7&#93; and which was acquired by Solexa in 2004 from the company Manteia Predictive Medicine. It is being used to perform a range of analyses, including whole genome resequencing, gene-expression analysis, and small ribonucleic acid (sRNA) analysis.<br/>In June 2009, Illumina announced the launch of their own Personal Full Genome Sequencing Service at a depth of 30X for $48,000 per genome,&#91;8&#93; and a year later dropped the price to $19,500.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; As of May 2011, Illumina reduced the price to $4,000.&#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93;<br/>Until 2010, Illumina sold only instruments that were labeled \"for research use only\"; in early 2010, Illumina obtained FDA approval for its BeadXpress system to be used in clinical tests.&#91;13&#93;&#91;14&#93; This was part of the company's strategy at the time to open its own CLIA lab and begin offering clinical genetic testing itself.&#91;15&#93;<br/>Illumina acquired Epicentre Biotechnologies, based in Madison, Wisconsin, on January 11, 2011.&#91;16&#93; On January 25, 2012, Hoffmann-La Roche made an unsolicited bid to buy Illumina for $44.50 per share or about $5.7 billion.&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93; Roche tried other tactics, including raising its offer (to $51.00, for about $6.8 billion).&#91;19&#93; Illumina rejected the offer,&#91;2&#93;&#91;20&#93; and Roche abandoned the offer in April.&#91;21&#93;<br/>In 2014, the company announced a multimillion-dollar product, HiSeq X Ten, that it forecast would provide large-scale whole-genome sequencing for $1,000/genome.&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93; The company claimed that 40 such machines would be able to sequence more genomes in one year than had been produced by all other sequencers to date.&#91;24&#93; In January 2014, Illumina already held 70% of the market for genome-sequencing machines.&#91;25&#93; Illumina machines accounted for more than 90% of all DNA data produced.&#91;26&#93; In fact, the amount of data produced by Illumina machines is such that the company invested in the acquisition of the pre-commercial firm Enancio in 2020, which had developed a DNA data compression algorithm specifically targeting Illumina data capable of reducing storage footprint by 80% (e.g. 50 Gb compressed to 10 Gb).&#91;27&#93;<br/>On July 5, 2016, Jay Flatley, who had been CEO since 1999, assumed the role of executive chairman of the board of directors. Francis deSouza took on the role of president and chief executive officer, and continues to serve on the Illumina board of directors.&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93;<br/>In late 2015, Illumina spun off the company GRAIL, focused on blood testing for cancer tumors in the bloodstream. In 2017 the company had planned to raise $1 billion in its second round of financing, and received funding from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos investing $100 million in series A funding, and with Illumina maintaining a 20% holding share in Grail.&#91;30&#93; The company is working with a blood test trial with over 120,000 women during scheduled mammogram visits in the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, as well as a partnership with the Mayo Clinic. The company Grail uses Illumina sequencing technology for tests.&#91;31&#93; The company plans to roll out the tests by 2019, with a cost of $500 per individual.&#91;32&#93; In September 2020, Illumina announced a proposed cash and stock deal to acquire Grail for $8 billion.&#91;33&#93;&#91;34&#93;<br/>In November 2018, the company proposed the acquisition of Pacific Biosciences for $8.00 per share or around $1.2 billion in total.&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93; In December 2019, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the acquisition.&#91;37&#93; The proposed deal was abandoned on January 2, 2020, with Illumina paying Pacific a $98 million termination fee.&#91;38&#93;<br/>In March 2021, the FTC sued to block Illumina's vertical merger with GRAIL.&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93;<br/>Acquisition history<br/>The following is an illustration of the company's mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs and historical predecessors:<br/>Illumina, Inc.<br/>Spyder Instruments (Acq 1999)<br/>CyVera, Inc.

The technology features bridge amplification to generate clusters and reversible terminators for sequence determination.&#91;41&#93;&#91;42&#93; The technology behind these sequencing systems involves ligation of fragmented DNA to a chip, followed by primer addition and sequential fluorescent dNTP incorporation and detection.<br/>Three of the most popular Illumina sequencers are the MiSeq, HiSeq, and NovaSeq. From a single run, the MiSeq generates 30 million reads, the HiSeq generates 3 billion reads, and the NovaSeq generates 13 billion reads. Meanwhile, traditional Sanger sequencing generates approximately 400 reads. Comparatively, the NovaSeq has the ability to generate 4 trillion bases in a day whereas Sanger sequencing can only generate one million bases per day. New machines have the capacity to sequence the entire human genome in 48 hours at the price of $1,000. Illumina sequencers are highly accurate, and only have an error once every thousand bases.&#91;43&#93;<br/>Flow cells (MiSeq, HiSeq, and NovaSeq)<br/>MiSeq Flow Cell (Top)<br/>NovaSeq Flow Cell<br/>Illumina sequencing happens within the flow cells. These flow cells are small in size and are housed in the flow cell compartment. In MiSeq sequencers, the flow cell can generate between 1 million and 30 million reads per run. The HiSeq flow cell is larger than that of the MiSeq and has the ability to generate 3 billion reads per run. Lastly, the NovaSeq flow cell is the largest of the three and can generate 13 billion reads per run. Flow cell clustering happens when a denatured DNA sample is placed in a flow cell. Primers already in the flow cell channel capture and bind to the ends of the short denatured DNA sample. Then, DNA polymerase is added and the DNA building blocks are introduced. This results in a newly synthesized strand constrained to the bottom of the flow cell. Next, the original template strand is washed out binding the newly synthesized strand to the other DNA sequence present on the surface. DNA polymerase and building blocks are introduced again forming a new strand. These steps are repeated until about 1,000 copies are made in a cluster.&#91;43&#93;<br/>Litigation<br/>Ambox current red Americas.svg<br/>This section needs to be updated.

(July 2018)<br/>In 2005, co-founder and former Chief Scientific Officer Anthony Czarnik sued Illumina; see Czarnik v. Illumina Inc.<br/>In 2010, Cornell University and Life Technologies filed a lawsuit against Illumina, alleging that its microarray products infringed on eight patents held by the university and exclusively licensed to the start-up. The case was settled in April 2017 without any finding of fault. In September 2017 both parties asked to have the settlement reviewed, with Cornell accusing both Illumina and Life Technologies of misrepresentation and fraud.&#91;44&#93;<br/>In February 2016, Illumina filed a lawsuit against Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which was the first company to commercialize nanopore sequencing. Illumina claimed that Oxford Nanopore infringed its patents on the use of a biological nanopore, Mycobacterium smegmatis porinA (MspA), for sequencing systems.&#91;45&#93;&#91;46&#93; In August 2016 both parties eventually settled their patent lawsuit, with Oxford Nanopore Technologies moving to instead use the CsgG nanopore derived from Escherichia coli, which it licensed from VIB in Belgium.&#91;47&#93;<br/>In February 2020, Illumina filed a patent infringement suit against BGI relating to its \"CoolMPS\" sequencing products.&#91;48&#93; In return BGI has filed patent infringement lawsuits for violation of federal antitrust and California unfair competition laws, claiming use of \"fraudulent behavior\" to obtain or enforce sequencing patents that it has asserted against BGI, preventing the firm from entering the US market.&#91;49&#93;<br/><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina,_Inc.\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina,_Inc.</a><br/>Illumina, Inc.<br/>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>Jump to navigationJump to search<br/>Illumina, Inc.<br/>Illumina logo.svg<br/>Type&#9;Public<br/>Traded as&#9;Nasdaq: ILMN<br/>NASDAQ-100 Component<br/>S&P 500 Component<br/>Industry&#9;Biotechnology<br/>Founded&#9;1998<br/>Founder&#9;<br/>David Walt<br/>Larry Bock<br/>John Stuelpnagel<br/>Anthony Czarnik<br/>Mark Chee<br/>Headquarters&#9;San Diego, California, U.S.<br/>Key people&#9;<br/>Francis deSouza (President & CEO)<br/>John W.

As of 2021 it works via affiliates or branches in 79 countries and territories, as well as across every state in the US.<br/>Founded in 1951, The Nature Conservancy has over one million members globally as of 2021, and has protected more than 119,000,000 acres (48,000,000 ha) of land and thousands of miles of rivers worldwide.&#91;when?&#93;&#91;where?&#93; As of 2014, it is the largest environmental non-profit organization by assets and revenue in the Americas.<br/>Contents<br/>1&#9;History<br/>2&#9;Project sites<br/>3&#9;Plant a Billion Trees campaign<br/>4&#9;Operations<br/>5&#9;See also<br/>6&#9;References<br/>7&#9;External links<br/>History<br/>The Nature Conservancy at 2017 Capital Pride<br/>The Nature Conservancy developed out of a scholarly organization initially known as the Ecological Society of America (ESA).&#91;4&#93; The ESA was founded in 1915, and later formed a Committee on Preservation of Natural Areas for Ecological Study, headed by Victor Shelford.&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93; The primary aim of Shelford was to find areas of land that would be beneficial for long-term research.&#91;4&#93; By the 1930s, Shelford and his colleagues such as Aldo Leopold increasingly sought to advocate for conservation.&#91;4&#93; The divide in viewpoints regarding scholarship or advocacy led the Society to dissolve the committee and in 1946, Shelford and his colleagues formed the Ecologists' Union.&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93; The latter group eventually took the name \"The Nature Conservancy\", in emulation of the British agency of that name, which pursued a mission of conserving open space and wildlife preserves. The Nature Conservancy was incorporated in the United States as a non-profit organization on October 22, 1951.&#91;5&#93;<br/>As the organization grew, the organization focused largely on buying as much land as possible in the name of conservation with little scientific research conducted on land before being purchased.&#91;4&#93; It was not until 1974 that the organization hired its first staff scientist, Robert Jenkins, Jr., who helped the organization refocus its mission to a more representational approach to conservation.&#91;4&#93; Jenkins began to focus on gathering detailed information on all the species present in a particular area which later morphed into the Natural Heritage Network, a network of state natural heritage programs.&#91;4&#93;<br/>Sexual harassment investigation<br/>After service as The Nature Conservancy's president for one year, Brian McPeek, resigned on May 31, 2019, after a report on an internal investigation of sexual harassment was revealed by Politico and two other senior executives were ultimately dismissed based on its findings.&#91;7&#93; On June 7, 2019, Mark Tercek, CEO since 2008, announced his resignation following the resignation of McPeek.&#91;8&#93; On June 10, Luis Solorzano, executive director of The Nature Conservancy's Florida-based Caribbean chapter, became the fifth senior official to depart the organization.&#91;9&#93; On June 11, The Nature Conservancy's board chairman Thomas J. Tierney announced that board member and former US Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell would serve as interim CEO, effective September 2019.&#91;10&#93;<br/>Project sites<br/>Nature Conservancy of Tennessee's William B. Clark, Sr., Nature Preserve on the Wolf River at Rossville, Tennessee<br/>The Nature Conservancy's expanding international conservation efforts include work in North America, Central America, and South America, Africa, the Pacific Rim, the Caribbean, and Asia.&#91;11&#93;<br/>North America<br/>The Nature Conservancy and its conservation partner, Pronatura Peninsula Yucat&#225;n, are working to halt deforestation on private lands in and around the 1.8 million acre (7,300 km2) Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, along the Guatemala&#8211;Mexico border. In November 2004, 370,000 acres (1,500 km2) of threatened tropical forest in Calakmul were permanently protected under a historic land deal between the Mexican federal and state government, Pronatura Peninsula Yucat&#225;n, four local communities and the Conservancy.&#91;12&#93;<br/>The Nature Conservancy's programs in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming are working together to build partnerships and enhance the profile of the conservation needs in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem by supporting voluntary, private land conservation of important wildlife habitat.<br/>In 2007, the Nature Conservancy made a 161,000-acre (650 km2) purchase of New York forestland from Finch Paper Holdings LLC for $110 million, its largest purchase ever in that state.&#91;13&#93;&#91;14&#93; In June 2008, The Nature Conservancy and The Trust for Public Land announced they reached an agreement to purchase approximately 320,000 acres (1,300 km2) of western Montana forestland from Plum Creek Timber Company for $510 million. The purchase, known as the Montana Legacy Project, is part of an effort to keep these forests in productive timber management and protect the area's clean water and abundant fish and wildlife habitat, while promoting continued public access to these lands for fishing, hiking, hunting and other recreational pursuits.&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93;&#91;17&#93; As a follow-on, in 2015 The Nature Conservancy made a $134 million transaction to purchase 165,073 acres &#8211; 257 square miles &#8211; of forests, rivers and wildlife habitat in the Cascade Mountain Range of Washington and in the Blackfoot River Valley in Montana. The Conservancy also acquired this land from Plum Creek, including 47,921 acres in the Yakima River Headwaters in Washington and 117,152 acres in the Lower Blackfoot River Watershed in Montana.&#91;18&#93;&#91;19&#93;<br/>Nature United is the Canadian affiliate of The Nature Conservancy. Nature United was founded as a Canadian charity in 2014, building on decades of conservation in Canada. Headquartered in Toronto, the organization has field staff located across the country. Nature United supports Indigenous leadership, sustainable economic development, and large-scale conservation, primarily in the Great Bear Rainforest, Clayoquot Sound, the Northwest Territories, and northern Manitoba.&#91;20&#93;<br/>Asia<br/>In December 2015, The Nature Conservancy announced the finalization of the first ever debt swap in Seychelles aimed at ocean conservation. The new protected area increases the country's marine protected waters from less than 1 percent to more than 30 percent including support for the creation of the second largest Marine Protected Area in the Western Indian Ocean.&#91;21&#93; The debt swap deal was made possible through a partnership with the Seychelles Ministry of Finance, support of debt-holding nations including France, and grants from private organizations led by the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation.&#91;22&#93;<br/>Financing for this effort was organized by The Nature Conservancy's impact investing unit called NatureVest.&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93; NatureVest was created in 2014 with founding sponsorship from JPMorgan Chase with the stated goal of sourcing and putting to work at least $1 billion of impact investment capital for measurable conservation outcomes over three years.&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93; For their work on the Seychelles debt restructuring, The Nature Conservancy and JPMorgan Chase were given the FT/ITC Transformational Business Award for Achievement in Transformational Finance. The award is given by the Financial Times and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) for ground-breaking, commercially viable solutions to development challenges.&#91;27&#93;<br/>Plant a Billion Trees campaign<br/>The Nature Conservancy's Plant a Billion Trees campaign is an effort to plant one billion trees by across the globe in forests with the greatest need.&#91;28&#93;&#91;better source needed&#93; As a part of this launch, The Nature Conservancy pledged to plant 25 million trees as part of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)'s Billion Tree Campaign.&#91;29&#93;&#91;better source needed&#93; This campaign encourages individuals and organizations to plant their own trees around the world and record this action on the website as a tally.<br/>Environmental benefits<br/>The Plant a Billion Trees campaign has also been identified as a tool to help slow climate change with forest restoration being an effective way to help regulate emissions in the atmosphere and stabilize global climate.&#91;30&#93;<br/>The Nature Conservancy's Plant a Billion Trees campaign also aims to protect 10 critical watersheds in the Atlantic Forest that provide water and hydro power to more than 70 million people, create 20,000 direct jobs, and an additional 70,000 indirectly as part of this effort.&#91;31&#93;&#91;better source needed&#93;<br/>Tree planting<br/>The Nature Conservancy plants trees for every contribution donated by supporters.&#91;32&#93; Some of the seeds being planted in Brazil consist of:<br/>Guapuruvu Tree (Schizolobium parahyba) &#8211; An indigenous plant of Atlantic Forest, this has one of the fastest growth rates of all the native species.<br/>Golden Trumpet Tree (Handroanthus chrysotrichus) &#8211; According to popular belief, when this tree's yellow blooms appear, no more frosts will occur. The wood of a Golden Trumpet Tree has the same fire rating as concrete and is denser than water. Illegal logging activity has grown due to this tree's growing popularity.<br/>Ice-Cream Bean Tree (Inga edulis) &#8211; Leafy and abundant, this tree controls weeds and erosion. Its popular fruit is a long pod up to a few feet, containing a sweet pulp surrounding large seeds.<br/>Capororoca Tree (Myrsine ferruginea) &#8211; Birds like the Rufous-bellied Thrush enjoy the fruit off of this tree.&#91;28&#93;&#91;better source needed&#93;<br/>Operations<br/>The Nature Conservancy has over one million members across the world as of 2021.&#91;33&#93;&#91;34&#93;<br/>Big business ties<br/>As of 2014, it was the largest environmental non-profit organization by assets and revenue in the Americas.&#91;35&#93;<br/>The Nature Conservancy has ties to many large companies, including those in the oil, gas, mining, chemical and agricultural industries.&#91;36&#93; As of 2016, its board of directors included the retired chairman of Duke Energy, and executives from Merck, HP, Google and several financial industry groups.&#91;37&#93; It also has a Business Council which it describes as a consultative forum that includes Bank of America, BP America, Chevron, Coca-Cola, Dow Chemical, Duke Energy, General Mills, Royal Dutch Shell, and Starbucks.&#91;38&#93; The organization faced criticism in 2010 from supporters for its refusal to cut ties with BP after the Gulf oil spill.&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93;<br/>Writer and activist Naomi Klein has strongly criticized The Nature Conservancy for earning money from an oil well on land it controls in Texas and for its continued engagement with fossil fuel companies.&#91;41&#93;&#91;42&#93;<br/>In 2020, Bloomberg published an article claiming that some of the companies (such as JPMorgan Chase, Disney, and BlackRock) that purchase carbon credits from The Nature Conservancy were purchasing carbon credits for forests that did not need protection.&#91;43&#93;<br/>Efficiency and accountability<br/>The Charity Navigator gave The Nature Conservancy a 3-star overall rating, a 2-star financial rating and a 4-star accountability and transparency rating for the 2019 fiscal year.&#91;44&#93;<br/>Hunting<br/>Like many large environmental groups such as the Sierra Club and the World Wildlife Fund, the Conservancy including allowances for hunting and fishing within its management policies. The organization does not totally ban hunting or fishing but defers to state hunting and fishing regulations.&#91;45&#93;<br/>Publication<br/>The organization publishes The Nature Conservancy magazine (ISSN 1540-2428; six issues per year).<br/>Resale<br/>There have been allegations of The Nature Conservancy obtaining land and reselling it at a profit, sometimes to supporters and sometimes to large organizations that allows them to claim tax breaks.&#91;46&#93;&#91;47&#93;&#91;48&#93; The Nature Conservancy argues that the profit from such sales allows The Nature Conservancy to increase its preservation of what the Nature Conservancy claims are more important locations.&#91;49&#93; The Conservancy has established a no-net-profit policy that has been in effect for years for all transactions of this type, and a policy of ensuring that its disbursements offset any illicitly-generated revenues.&#91;50&#93;<br/>See also<br/>&#9;Earth sciences portal<br/>icon&#9;Ecology portal<br/>icon&#9;Environment portal<br/>Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance<br/>List of environmental issues<br/>List of environmental organizations<br/>Natural capital<br/>Natural environment<br/>Natural landscape<br/>Natural resource<br/>Northwest Alliance<br/>Private protected area<br/>Sustainability<br/>References<br/> Grove, Noel (December 1988). \"Quietly Conserving Nature\".

It is led by David Blumenthal, M.D.&#91;1&#93;<br/>Contents<br/>1&#9;Founding and early program history<br/>2&#9;Current leadership<br/>2.1&#9;President<br/>2.2&#9;Executive vice president and chief operating officer<br/>2.3&#9;The Commonwealth Fund Commission on a High Performance Health System<br/>3&#9;References<br/>4&#9;External links<br/>Founding and early program history<br/>The Commonwealth Fund, one of the first foundations to be established by a woman, was founded in 1918 with an endowment of almost $10 million by Anna M. Harkness. The widow of Stephen V. Harkness, a principal investor in Standard Oil, Mrs. Harkness wanted to &#8220;do something for the welfare of mankind.&#8221; Anna's son, Edward Stephen Harkness, became the Commonwealth Fund's first president and hired a staff of people to help him build the foundation. Edward Harkness possessed a \"passionate commitment to social reform\" and was \"determined to improve health and health services for Americans.\"&#91;2&#93; Through additional gifts and bequests between 1918 and 1959, the Harkness family's total contribution to the fund's endowment amounted to more than $53 million. Today,&#91;when?&#93; the Commonwealth Fund's endowment stands at almost $700 million.<br/>According to the Rockefeller Archive Center, the Commonwealth Fund's &#8220;early grants supported a variety of programs while generally promoting welfare, especially child welfare.&#8221;&#91;3&#93; Over the years, it has given support to medical schools and to the building of hospitals and clinics. In New York City, the Commonwealth Fund was a major contributor to the building of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center of the College of Physicians and Surgeons and Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia University in 1922. By the mid-1920s the chief interest of the foundation had become public health, including mental hygiene, community health, rural hospitals, medical research, and medical education.&#91;4&#93; Other grant areas included war relief, educational and legal research, and international medical fellowships.&#91;3&#93;<br/>In 1925, the Commonwealth Fund launched its international program of fellowships called the Commonwealth Fund Fellowships (now the Harkness Fellowships).&#91;5&#93; Until the 1990s, the fellowship was open to scholars of all academic disciplines, and included many who went on to excel in science, the arts and business.<br/>From the late 1920s through the 1940s, the Commonwealth Fund supported the construction of rural hospitals, paving the way for the Hill-Burton Act in 1946.&#91;6&#93; Following World War II, the foundation supported the development of new medical schools in the United States in an effort to address doctor shortages and meet the needs of communities lacking health care services. Other achievements include the Rochester Regional Hospital Council and the development of the Nurse Practitioner and Physician Assistant professions.&#91;7&#93;<br/>Child receiving rabies inoculation<br/>In the 1940s, the fund supported research by Dr. Georgios Papanikolaou that pioneered the Pap test&#91;8&#93; as the basic technique for detecting cervical cancer.

Understanding and learning from these data and modelling the complex processes they reflect is a pressing concern in the scientific community. At the same time, advances in concepts, algorithms and computation are enabling new kinds of simulations that can capture rich nonlinear, and often time-dependent, processes. These simulations demand increased sophistication in scientific technique, algorithmic development and computation.<br/>The Simons Foundation launched the Flatiron Institute to address these challenges, developing new conceptual, algorithmic and computational methods and bringing them to bear on important scientific issues. The institute provides a highly interactive research environment for physicists, biologists, astronomers, neuroscientists, chemists, computational scientists, data scientists and programmers to work together to create, deploy, apply and support state-of-the-art computational methods.<br/>The institute currently comprises the Center for Computational Biology, launched in 2013 as the Simons Center for Data Analysis; the Center for Computational Astrophysics, launched in 2016; the Center for Computational Quantum Physics, launched in 2017; the Center for Computational Mathematics, launched in 2018; and the Center for Computational Neuroscience, launched in 2020. The work of these centers is supported by the Scientific Computing Core.<br/>To learn more, please visit the Flatiron Institute.<br/>The Simons Foundation makes grants in four areas: Mathematics and Physical Sciences, Life Sciences, autism research (Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative) and Outreach & Education. Our Simons Collaborations are a new funding model for the foundation, spanning Mathematics and Physical Sciences and Life Sciences.<br/>The Simons Foundation seeks to create strong collaborations and foster the cross-pollination of ideas between investigators, as these interactions often lead to unexpected breakthroughs. In an effort to promote such interaction between scientists, in 2012 the foundation launched a new collaborative funding model, the Simons Collaborations, which bring funded investigators &#8212; sometimes from different disciplines &#8212; together to work on a timely and important problem. To date, 21 Simons Collaborations have been launched in and across our Mathematics and Physical Sciences and Life Sciences divisions.<br/>The Simons Foundation Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS) division supports research in mathematics, theoretical physics and theoretical computer science by providing funding for individuals, institutions and science infrastructure.<br/>To learn more about MPS programs, please visit Mathematics and Physical Sciences.<br/>The Simons Foundation Life Sciences division seeks to advance basic research on fundamental questions in biology, with a focus on origins of life, microbial oceanography and microbial ecology and evolution.<br/>To find out more, please visit our Life Sciences pages.<br/>The Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI)&#8217;s mission is to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorder by funding innovative research of the highest quality and relevance. SFARI offers grant programs to support bold, imaginative and rigorous research, relevant to its mission. Standing Request for Application (RFA) programs include Research and Pilot Awards, as well as Bridge to Independence Awards. Targeted RFAs are offered on an ad-hoc basis.<br/>To facilitate and drive research in the field as a whole, SFARI has created and maintains several resources for autism scientists. The online magazine Spectrum provides comprehensive news and analysis of advances in autism research.<br/>For more information on SFARI, please visit SFARI.org.<br/>The Simons Foundation&#8217;s Outreach & Education programs seek to stimulate a deeper interest and understanding of science and mathematics among students, professionals and the interested public.<br/>The foundation&#8217;s Science Sandbox initiative supports and collaborates with programs that unlock scientific thinking in everyone. The division&#8217;s education initiative, Math for America, focuses on reaching secondary school students with a corps of outstanding STEM teachers and leaders in U.S. public schools. Quanta Magazine seeks to illuminate basic science and math research through public service journalism. Simons Foundation Lectures connect both practicing scientists and the interested public with some of the top minds in science in a lecture setting.<br/>To find out more, please visit our Outreach & Education pages.<br/>The Informatics Group manages the foundation&#8217;s many and expanding scientific and administrative data assets. Informatics provides guidance to some of the foundation&#8217;s data-intensive research grants and, importantly, advances the foundation&#8217;s commitment to the open sharing of information. Group members regularly collaborate on research projects with SFARI and the Flatiron Institute&#8217;s Center for Computational Biology, as well as with external investigators.

In July 2015, the African Union Ministers of Health meeting in Malabo had adopted the Statute of the Africa CDC, which called for fast-tracking the establishment of the institution.&#91;2&#93; The agency was officially launched in January 2017.&#91;1&#93;&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93;<br/>2019&#8211;21 COVID-19 pandemic<br/>The Africa CDC has played a role in responding to the global 2019&#8211;20 COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected Africa. In early April 2020, Director Dr John Nkengasong condemned remarks by two French scientists Professors Jean-Paul Mira and Camille Locht suggesting that a potential tuberculosis vaccine for the coronavirus be test in Africa as \"disgusting and racist.\" Dr Mira has since apologized for his remarks.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;<br/>On 2 May 2020, the Africa CDC confirmed had nearly 40,000 cases, nearly 1,700 deaths, and more than 13,000 recoveries, and that COVID-19 had occurred in 53 African countries.&#91;8&#93; As of June 18, 2020, Africa CDC reported that 52 African Union Member States recorded a number of 267,519 cases, 7197 deaths, and 122,661 recoveries.&#91;9&#93; Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa were considered the countries with the highest risk to import the virus and with a moderate to high capability to block the virus outbreak.&#91;9&#93;<br/>The Africa CDC has also worked with the Jack Ma Foundation to distribute COVID-19 testing kits throughout the continent. In 7 May, Dr Nkengasong disputed Tanzanian President John Magufuli's criticism that these tests were faulty and giving too many false positives.&#91;10&#93;<br/>On 6 January 2021, the Africa CDC reported that the total number of cases in Africa has reached 2,854,971 while the death toll has reached 67,986 and that 2,361,900 have recovered.&#91;11&#93; On May 21, 2021, 55 member states of the African Union declared 4,732,150 cases, 127,612 deaths, and 4,238,275 recoveries.&#91;12&#93;<br/>On 13 April 2021, the Partnership for African Vaccine Manufacturing was launched, aiming to increase vaccine production in Africa.

However, this optimism must be tempered by several important factors. The likelihood of achieving herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is low simply because not all individuals in the US are eligible to be vaccinated and a quarter of eligible individuals will likely decline to be immunized. Moreover, the vaccines do not provide full immunity against infection, and the currently available vaccines are less effective against variant B.1.351, and possibly other variants. Accordingly, the public and health systems need to plan for the possibility that COVID-19 will persist and become a recurrent seasonal disease.<br/>Herd immunity is a theoretical construct from infectious disease modeling that posits that in a population in which every individual is equally likely to encounter every other individual, transmission will not be sustained when immunity through past infection, vaccination, or both reaches the level of 1&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;(1/R), where R is the number of infections caused by a single infection in a population in which everyone is susceptible.1 Reality diverges from this simple notion. First, because COVID-19 is clearly seasonal, like other coronaviruses, the herd immunity level will be lower in the summer and higher in the winter. Second, herd immunity depends on how much interaction individuals have with one another, which will vary by state or city after social distancing mandates are lifted. Third, nonrandom mixing (individuals are not equally likely to interact with one another) can lead to modifications of the level of immunity required to stop transmission. Despite these factors, some public health officials suggest that achieving winter herd immunity in the presence of new more contagious variants will require more than 70% to 80% of individuals to be immune.<br/>Three key considerations will make achieving herd immunity against COVID-19 challenging. First, vaccines will have a reduced effect on preventing infection from the B.1.351 variant. Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have an overall effectiveness against symptomatic disease of approximately 95% for wild-type variants, whereas adenovirus vector vaccines, such as the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine, have effectiveness closer to 70%. Evidence on vaccine efficacy for preventing infection, however, comes only from 1 group in the AstraZeneca trial that showed 55% protection against infection as measured through weekly nasal swabs vs 70% protection for symptomatic disease.2 Furthermore, for the 3 vaccines tested against the B.1.351 variant, Janssen, Novavax, and AstraZeneca reported effectiveness estimates for symptomatic disease of 57%,3 49%,4 and a statistically nonsignificant percentage, respectively. If the B.1.351 variant becomes dominant, a simple calculation suggests that the aggregate effectiveness of vaccines for preventing B.1.351 transmission in the US could be only 50% (ie, based on current effectiveness of 90% to prevent symptomatic disease &#215; 20% reduction of efficacy for preventing infection compared with symptomatic disease and assuming an average reduction in efficacy for B.1.351 of 33% &#91;excluding the statistically insignificant protection from the AstraZeneca vaccine&#93;).<br/>Second, not enough individuals will receive the vaccine. Because the vaccines are currently not authorized for use in children, only approximately 75% of US individuals are eligible to be immunized. Perhaps more important in the long run, not all individuals are willing be immunized. Data collected daily through Facebook&#8217;s Data for Good initiative provide timely information on the proportion of individuals who respond yes or &#8220;yes, probably&#8221; to the question, Will you take the vaccine if offered it? These positive responses regarding likelihood of vaccine receipt increased in January 2021 and have reached 71%,5 similar to the 72% response in a nationally representative sample.6 Even with an effective approved vaccine for children, if B.1.351 or some other variant becomes dominant, the US can expect vaccine-derived immunity to reach only 37.5% (the estimated potential 50% aggregate efficacy for transmission &#215; 75% of individuals receiving the vaccine) in 2021 if all supply and administration difficulties are overcome.<br/>Third, there is concern about the extent to which previous infections from one variant protect individuals from reinfection with some new variants. Novavax reported that in a phase 2b clinical trial in South Africa, the COVID-19 incidence rate in the placebo group, predominantly from variant B.1.351, was 3.9% both among individuals with COVID-19 seropositivity and those who were COVID-19 seronegative.7 The interpretation by Novavax of this finding has been that past infection provides no immunity against new variants. If that is true, herd immunity can be achieved only through vaccination. But if B.1.351 spreads widely, vaccine-derived immunity will likely be much lower than the levels required to reach herd immunity by the 2021-2022 northern hemisphere winter.<br/>Various models suggest continuing COVID-19 surges are possible even without B.1.351 dominance.8 A winter surge of infection with B.1.351 dominance may occur in 2021-2022. Hospitalization and death rates, however, may be expected to be lower, assuming vaccines remain more effective for preventing symptomatic disease and remain effective for preventing severe disease and death. For example, the Janssen vaccine was more than 85% effective against severe disease, even in South Africa, with no hospitalizations or deaths reported in the trial, albeit with a very wide CI for these outcomes.3 If transmission remained similar to what occurred this winter, hospitalizations and deaths should be less in winter 2021-2022. But the magnitude of the winter surge also depends on behavior. Through mask wearing and social distancing, only an estimated 19% of US residents have been infected so far. In the next winter, it will be problematic to maintain social distancing mandates due to public fatigue and the potential lasting effect of the pandemic on the economy. Despite the protection from vaccination, effective R in the absence of concerted social distancing and low levels of mask use could be higher next winter than this winter.<br/>If new variants continue to appear, winter surges may become the norm. This prospect requires advance planning and consideration of a range of strategies to mitigate the consequences for communities and health systems. Five strategies should be considered and vigorously debated in the months ahead.<br/>1. Intensify global vaccination efforts. New variants can appear anywhere and more transmission will increase the likelihood of their emergence. Intensified expansion of vaccination in low- and middle-income countries along with high-income countries could help reduce the harm of recurrent seasonal COVID-19 and could reduce the frequency of new variants.<br/>2. Monitor the epidemic and the emergence of new variants and accelerate the modification of vaccines to enhance their efficacy for emerging high-risk variants if they are shown to significantly reduce vaccine protection. The US, European Union, and other high-income countries should invest in global surveillance, including with genome sequencing, to facilitate early detection of variants and track trends at the local level. Strategies of creating multivalent vaccines and adapting vaccines to new variants through boosters will need to be deployed rapidly to maintain overall vaccine efficacy. If variants continue to emerge, it is possible that annual vaccination will be needed, similar to that for seasonal influenza. However, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data indicate that seasonal influenza vaccine uptake averaged 50% and estimated vaccine efficacy averaged 35% from 2014 to 2019.9 For COVID-19, the identification of new variants and modification of vaccines to be efficacious for these variants would need to be more effective.<br/>3. Manage and finance winter hospital surges. COVID-19 has burdened intensive care units (ICUs) in the US this winter. Social distancing measures have reduced COVID-19 transmission and substantially reduced influenza transmission. US hospitals have avoided the double pressure on bed availability from both influenza and COVID-19 infection. A shift to recurrent seasonal COVID-19 makes it unlikely governments would adopt social distancing mandates every winter, potentially leading to hospitalizations for influenza and COVID-19. ICU bed availability pressure could require halting elective procedures in peak months such as December and January. Hospitals may need to develop greater capacity to respond to surges with sufficient bed capacity and personnel, and anticipate associated financial implications. Financing mechanisms that address that currently hospital income is driven by elective procedures would need to be considered.<br/>4. Reduce transmission in peak months through employer and educational institution action. Although it is unlikely that the federal government or state governments will use social distancing mandates every winter, employers and educational institutions could adopt certain measures. Actions could include establishing mandatory vaccination, requiring masks during peak transmission months, and avoiding superspreader events by moving meetings or classes with attendance above a certain number to digital platforms. Requiring vaccination where legally allowed could help increase vaccination rates. Requiring mask use in the winter months could contribute both to reduced transmission in those settings and cultural change toward accepting mask use as normal.<br/>5. Modify behavior of at-risk individuals. Increased risk of death in a winter surge may be large enough to motivate at-risk individuals to change their behavior. Higher-risk individuals (eg, aged &#8805;65 years or with comorbidities) would need to consider winter behavioral modification such as mask wearing and avoiding congregate settings such as bars, indoor dining, concerts, and sports events, and any setting in which transmission risk is high.<br/>It is not clear whether COVID-19 will become a chronic seasonal disease. There is too much uncertainty about the probability and frequency of emergence of new variants, the reduction in vaccine efficacy for each variant, the critical question of cross-variant immunity, and the consistency of safe human behavior. However, the prospect of persistent and seasonal COVID-19 is real. If immunity from infection for the same SARS-CoV-2 variant or vaccine-derived immunity wanes, the prospect would increase further. There is much to learn in the coming months about variants, vaccines, and immunity. Recurrent seasonal COVID-19 could require both health system change and profound cultural adjustment for the life of high-risk individuals in the winter months. There is an urgent need to prepare for such a scenario by aligning surveillance, medical response, public health response, and socioeconomic programs.<br/>Back to topArticle Information<br/>Corresponding Author: Christopher J.

It manages ten regional centers and functional programs related to international security and global economic prosperity. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C.. It is a member of the Atlantic Treaty Association.<br/>History<br/>The Atlantic Council was founded with the stated mission to encourage the continuation of cooperation between North America and Europe that began after World War II. In its early years, its work consisted largely of publishing policy papers and polling Europeans and Americans about their attitudes towards transatlantic and international cooperation. In these early years, its primary focus was on economic issues&#8212;mainly encouraging free trade between the two continents, and to a lesser extent to the rest of the world&#8212;but it also did some work on political and environmental issues.&#91;2&#93;<br/>Although the Atlantic Council did publish policy papers and monographs, Melvin Small of Wayne State University wrote that, especially in its early years, the Council's real strength lay in its connections to influential policymakers. The Council early on found a niche as \"center for informal get-togethers\" of leaders from both sides of the Atlantic, with members working to develop \"networks of continuing communication\".&#91;2&#93;<br/>The Atlantic Council also works outside Europe and the U.S. It was among the first organizations advocating an increased Japanese presence in the international community. Its Asian programs have expanded since 2001 as a consequence of the war in Afghanistan leading to the opening of its South Asia Center and Program on Asia. Climate change, and coordinating with India and China on these issues, were also a factor in this development.&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93;<br/>In February 2009, James L. Jones, then-chairman of the Atlantic Council, stepped down in order to serve as President Obama's new National Security Advisor and was succeeded by Senator Chuck Hagel.&#91;4&#93; In addition, other Council members also left to serve the administration: Susan Rice as ambassador to the UN, Richard Holbrooke as the Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, General Eric K. Shinseki as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and Anne-Marie Slaughter as Director of Policy Planning at the State Department. Four years later, Hagel stepped down to serve as US Secretary of Defense. Gen. Brent Scowcroft served as interim chairman of the organization's Board of Directors until January 2014, when former ambassador to China and governor of Utah Jon Huntsman Jr.&#91;5&#93; was appointed.<br/>In September 2014, The Atlantic Council hired Call of Duty: Black Ops series director Dave Anthony as a nonresident senior fellow.&#91;6&#93;<br/>In 2017, Tom Bossert, previously a Nonresident Zurich Cyber Risk Fellow at the Atlantic Council's Cyber Security Initiative, was appointed Homeland Security Advisor to the Trump administration.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>Connections and funding<br/>The Atlantic Council has, since its inception, stated it is a nonpartisan institution, with members \"from the moderate internationalist wings of both parties\" in the United States.&#91;2&#93; Despite its connections, the Council is by charter independent of the U.S. government and NATO, a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.&#91;2&#93;<br/>In September 2014, Eric Lipton reported in The New York Times that since 2008, the US organization had received donations from more than twenty-five foreign governments. He wrote that the Atlantic Council was one of a number of think tanks that received substantial overseas funds and conducted activities that \"typically align with the foreign governments&#8217; agendas\".&#91;7&#93;<br/>The Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East was established with a donation from Bahaa Hariri and its founding head was Michele Dunne. After Mohamed Morsi was removed as President of Egypt by the military in 2013, Dunne urged the United States to suspend military aid to Egypt and called Morsi&#8217;s removal a \"military coup\". Bahaa Hariri complained to the Atlantic Council about Dunne's actions and four months later Dunne resigned her position.&#91;7&#93;<br/>In 2014, The Atlantic Council produced a report promoting the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) -- a proposed trade-accommodation agreement between the European Union and the US&#8212;with the financial backing of FedEx, who were simultaneously lobbying Congress directly to decrease transatlantic tariffs.&#91;8&#93;<br/>In 2015 and 2016, the three largest donors, giving over $1 million USD each, were US millionaire Adrienne Arsht (executive vice chair&#91;9&#93;), Lebanese billionaire Bahaa Hariri (estranged brother of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri&#91;10&#93;), and the United Arab Emirates.&#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93; The Ukrainian oligarch run Burisma Holdings donated $100,000 per year for three years to the Atlantic Council starting in 2016.&#91;13&#93; The full list of financial sponsors includes many military, financial, and corporate concerns.&#91;14&#93;<br/>The leading donors in 2018 were Facebook and the British government.&#91;15&#93;<br/>Events<br/>The Atlantic Council creates a meeting place for heads of state, military leaders, and international leaders from both sides of the Atlantic. Recently,&#91;when?&#93; the Council hosted former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen's first major U.S. speech, in which he discussed issues such as NATO's mission in the War in Afghanistan, NATO cooperation with Russia, and the broader transatlantic relationship.&#91;16&#93; Members of the U.S. Congress have also appeared, including Senator Richard Lugar and Secretary of State John Kerry.&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93; The Council hosts events with sitting heads of state and government, including former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili,&#91;19&#93; Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk,&#91;20&#93; and former Latvian President Vaira V&#299;&#311;e-Freiberga.&#91;21&#93;<br/>Since January 2007, the Council has hosted military leaders from both sides of the Atlantic. The council's Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security has, held periodic events known as the Commanders Series, where it invites military leaders from the United States and Europe to speak about conflicts of interest to the Atlantic community.&#91;22&#93; As part of the Commanders Series, American military leaders such as former General George Casey&#91;23&#93; and former Admiral Timothy Keating&#91;24&#93; and European leaders like former French Chief of Defense General Jean-Louis Georgelin&#91;25&#93; and Dutch Lieutenant General Ton van Loon&#91;26&#93; have spoken on issues such as the Iraq War, the war in Afghanistan, and security threats in Asia and Africa.<br/>Its annual events include the Distinguished Leadership Awards in Washington, DC; the Future Leaders Summit;&#91;27&#93; the Freedom Awards in Wroclaw, Poland; the Atlantic Council Energy & Economic Summit in Istanbul, Turkey and the Global Citizen Awards in New York City.&#91;citation needed&#93;<br/>On February 22, 2019, the Atlantic Council released its Declaration of Principles at the Munich Security Conference.

Through online tools and regular events, the Young Atlanticist Network serves as a forum for open dialogue between young Atlanticists so they can exchange their views on a range of international issues. As a meeting place, the Network serves as a stage for global leaders to address the next generation and to share the perspective on current issues.&#91;29&#93;<br/>The Young Atlanticist Network also manages the Future Leaders program. The Council hosted the 2014 Future Leaders Summit on the side-lines of the NATO 2014 Wales summit. This Future Leaders Summit connected emerging leaders from NATO member countries with one another, the Alliance's current leaders, people from the international security sphere, and a global network of peers.&#91;29&#93;<br/>The Program on Transatlantic Relations promotes dialogue on the major issues that will affect the evolution of the transatlantic relationship. It believes that a healthy transatlantic relationship is an essential prerequisite for a stronger international system. The Council seeks to identify areas of potential cooperation and build the personal networks and mutual understanding that form the basis for an effective partnership.&#91;30&#93;<br/>The Council's Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security examines U.S. relationships with allies and adversaries in an effort to build consensus around policies that contribute to a more stable, secure and well-governed world.&#91;31&#93;<br/>The Global Business and Economics Program works to build upon and strengthen the already deep economic integration between Europe and the United States as well as promote Transatlantic leadership in the global economy.

These deliberations cover internal and external security, governance, trade, economic development, education and other issues.&#91;33&#93;<br/>The Energy and Environment program explores the economic and political aspects of energy security and supply, as well as international environmental issues. It promotes open access and clean air and offers policy recommendations to meet developing countries' needs through increased capital, technology and know-how in the energy and water supply sectors.&#91;34&#93;<br/>The Eurasia Center fosters dialogue among regional leaders, as well as counterparts from key neighbors and global leaders. Combining an understanding of Eurasia's history with knowledge of politics, economics, and energy, the Center provides research and advice to governments and businesses.

It develops pragmatic recommendations to put ideas into practice &#8211; helping governments, cities, businesses and other leaders to identify and address challenges before they become crises.&#91;39&#93;<br/>The Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab)<br/>The Digital Forensic Research Lab was founded in 2016,&#91;40&#93; to study disinformation in open source environments and report on democratic processes. The leading donors of the project and the think tank, in general, are currently&#91;when?&#93; Facebook, after a 2018 sum was donated, and the government of Great Britain.&#91;15&#93;<br/>On December 20, 2019, The New York Times reported, in \"Facebook Discovers Fakes That Show Evolution of Disinformation\", that Facebook had deleted \"hundreds of accounts with ties to the Epoch Media Group, the parent company of the conservative news outlet The Epoch Times\" using fake profile photos that had been generated using artificial intelligence. The DFRLab director Graham Brookie stated that the coordinated network of fake accounts demonstrated \"an eerie, tech-enabled future of disinformation\".&#91;41&#93;<br/>"},{"id":424,"title":"The Trilateral Commission","group":"Organization","image":"img/The_Trilateral_Commission.png","value":1,"notes":"<a href=\"https://trilateral.org/page/3/about-trilateral\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://trilateral.org/page/3/about-trilateral</a><br/>ABOUT THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION<br/>The Trilateral Commission is a non-governmental, policy-oriented forum that brings together leaders in their individual capacity from the worlds of business, government, academia, press and media, as well as civil society.  The Commission offers a global platform for open dialogue, reaching out to those with different views and engaging with decision makers from around the world with the aim of finding solutions to the great geopolitical, economic and social challenges of our time.  Its members share a firm belief in the values of rule of law, democratic government, human rights, freedom of speech and free enterprise that underpin human progress.  Members are also committed to supporting a rules-based international system, closer cooperation across borders and respect for the diversity of approaches to policy issues.<br/>The Trilateral Commission was formed in 1973 by private citizens of Japan, Europe (European Union countries), and North America (United States and Canada) to foster closer cooperation among these core industrialized areas of the world with shared leadership responsibilities in the wider international system. Originally established for three years, our work has been renewed for successive triennia (three-year periods), most recently for a triennium to be completed in 2015.<br/>When the first triennium of the Trilateral Commission was launched in 1973, the most immediate purpose was to draw together&#8212;at a time of considerable friction among governments&#8212;the highest-level unofficial group possible to look together at the key common problems facing our three areas. At a deeper level, there was a sense that the United States was no longer in such a singular leadership position as it had been in earlier post-World War II years, and that a more shared form of leadership&#8212;including Europe and Japan in particular&#8212;would be needed for the international system to navigate successfully the major challenges of the coming years.<br/>The &#8220;growing interdependence&#8221; that so impressed the founders of the Trilateral Commission in the early 1970s has deepened into &#8220;globalization.&#8221; That interdependence also has ensured that the unduring effects of the financial crisis that began in 2008 has been felt in every nation and region. It has fundamentally shaken confidence in the international system as a whole. The Commission sees in these unprecedented events a stronger need for shared thinking and leadership by the Trilateral countries, who (along with the principal international organizations) have been the primary anchors of the wider international system. Doubts about whether and how this primacy will change do not diminish, and, if anything, have intensified the need to take into account the dramatic transformation of the international system. As relations with other countries become more mature&#8212;and power more diffuse&#8212;the leadership tasks of the original Trilateral countries need to be carried out with others to an increasing extent.<br/>As our conviction has strengthened that the Commission remains more important than ever in helping our countries fulfill their shared leadership responsibilities in the wider international system, we too have changed. Our membership has widened to reflect broader changes in the world. Thus, the Japan Group has become a Pacific Asian Group, including in 2009 both Chinese and Indian members. Mexican members have been added to the North American Group. The European Group continues to widen in line with the enlargement of the EU. We are also continuing in this triennium our practice of inviting a number of participants from other key areas.<br/>The Trilateral Task Force on Global Capitalism in Transition<br/>Press Release, 26
